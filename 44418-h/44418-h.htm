<span class='smcap'>Genoa</span>, February 19th.
</p>

<p>
Your most interesting letter, Sir Philosopher,
reached me at Gibraltar, and served to give me a
homelike feeling in that alien land of Spain. Any
one who can write letters as interesting as yours,
from your library, with the mercury at zero outside,
and nothing more refreshing to look upon from the
window than snow and sleet, does not need to wander
in sunny lands and among ancient ruins for an inspiration.
No, travel would be absolutely wasted
upon you, who require only a cigar and a wood fire to
encourage your "reveries of a bachelor."
</p>

<p>
You wish to know what are my first impressions of
Italy, and how we three women get on together? To
be perfectly candid with you, we ourselves are not
wandering in sunny lands at present, and the cheerful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>10</a></span>
blaze of your library fire would prove most welcome
to benumbed fingers and pinched noses.
</p>

<p>
Our welcome to Genoa was not particularly cheerful.
It had been raining for days; the sky was heavy
with clouds, and the air chilly and damp. We can
well understand why the prudent and all-informing
Baedeker advises invalids visiting Genoa at this time
to guard against raw winds and abrupt changes of
temperature.
</p>

<p>
We enjoyed coming into the fine harbor, around
which Genoa is built upon its hills and terraces in the
form of a half-circle, the city widening out toward
the ends of the arc. On the hills, we know, are many
beautiful villas, seen to-day but dimly through veils
of mist, and beyond are the mountains, which in
clear weather must add much to the charm of this old
fortress as seen from the sea.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine says that it would be very ungrateful of
us if we were to complain of cloudy weather, as the
skies might be pouring down upon us instead of only
threatening, and, after all, we are having the same
good luck that we had in Madeira, Granada, and
Algiers in coming after the rain instead of before it.
</p>

<p>
And how do we get on together? Really, monsieur,
you display courage when you ask that question, as
I might here and now unburden my mind of a long
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11'>11</a></span>
list of grievances. As it is, however, I have so far
no woes to relate, although I know that a sojourn on
the Continent has wrecked many a friendship. We
three must appear to those who meet us an ill-assorted
trio; but because of our individualities we may be the
better fitted to stand the crucial test of a tour of indefinite
length, whose only object is pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine is the encyclopædia of the party, and, as
Angela says, her information is always on tap, besides
which she is amiable and refreshingly romantic. It
is inspiring to travel with a woman, no longer young,
to whom the world and its inhabitants still wear "the
glory and the dream." On the other hand, when one
is suffering from the discomforts of travel to such an
extent that it would be a luxury to moan and groan a
bit and find fault with the general condition of things,
it is a trifle irritating to see Zelphine sailing serenely
upon the seas of high content, apparently above such
trifling accidents as material comfort. You, being a
man and consequently a philosopher of greater or
less degree, may not be able to understand this; it is
just here that Zelphine and I might quarrel, but we
"generally most always" do not.
</p>

<p>
Angela you have scarcely known since she was a
little girl, when she was a prime favorite of yours. In
the half-hour in which you saw her, just before we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12'>12</a></span>
sailed, you must have realized that in appearance she
had fulfilled the promise of her beautiful childhood.
She is a spirited creature, but with a fine balance of
common sense, and with her delicate, spirituelle
beauty is astonishingly practical&mdash;an up-to-date girl,
in fine. Have you ever wondered, among your many
ponderings, why the girls of to-day, with the beauty
of their great-grandmothers, should be utterly devoid
of the sentiment that enhanced the loveliness of those
dear ladies as perfume adds to the charm of a flower?
This question I leave with you for future solution.
</p>

<p>
Here in Genoa we meet the narrow, precipitous
passages, streets by courtesy, which interested us in
the Moorish quarter of Algiers, dating back in both
cases to remote antiquity. They are to be found, we
are told, in every old Italian town. Many of them
answer to Hawthorne's description of the streets of
Perugia, which, he says, are "like caverns, being
arched all over and plunging down abruptly towards
an unknown darkness, which, when you have fathomed
its depths, admits you to a daylight that you
scarcely hoped to behold again."
</p>

<p>
Old palaces overshadow these narrow, crooked streets,
built many stories high and close together for protection
against enemies without and factional feuds
at home; such as those between the powerful houses
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13'>13</a></span>
of Doria, Spinola, Fieschi, and the like. The majority
of these buildings have fallen from their ancient
glory, and look, as Angela says, like tenement houses.
This plebeian association is carried out by the squalid
appearance of the inhabitants, and by the clothes-lines
stretched across the streets from window to
window, on which are hung garments of every size,
degree, color, and ingenuity of patch, the predominant
red and white lending a certain picturesqueness
to the motley array.
</p>

<p>
Turning a corner, we suddenly found ourselves
in the midst of a quarrel, or a violent altercation at
the best, between a pretty signora at a fourth-floor
window and a vendor of fruits and vegetables on the
sidewalk below. The language which the lady used,
as she leaned far out of the window, was so vigorous
that no interpreter was needed to make her meaning
plain: the merchant was a charlatan and a villain;
the saints were all called upon as witnesses to
his depravity. He, the so-called vendor of over-ripe
fruit, pointed to his wares, beating his breast and
spreading out his hands in token of his spotless
innocence. He sell over-ripe oranges? All his neighbors
would testify to his poverty and that of his family
because he, honest one, daily sacrificed hundreds of
oranges to satisfy his unreasonable customers!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14'>14</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The signora's dark eyes flashed, the Spanish mantilla
upon her head shook in sympathy with the
violence of her emotions, as she repeated her vocabulary
of epithets. We were thankful that four stories
separated the combatants, and retiring under the
shadow of a doorway we anxiously awaited results.
Something happened, we know not what; the fruit
may have been reduced the fraction of a penny;
whatever it was, a truce was declared, during which
the signora's basket, filled with fruit and artichokes,
was drawn up to the window by a rope. After the
lady had carefully inspected each individual fruit
and vegetable, she smiled blandly, lowered some
money in her basket, and the pair parted with bows
and compliments. Juliet on her balcony could not
have been more graceful, nor Romeo on the pavement
below more gallant than this shabby <i>venditore</i>, as he
swept the ground with his cap, one hand upon his
heart!
</p>

<p>
Feeling that we owed something to somebody for
the pleasure that this little drama had afforded us,
we crossed the street and bought from the chief
actor some fresh dates such as we had first tasted
in Algiers. As we paid the asking price without
protest, we felt quite sure that the valiant little
merchant was making off us anything that he may
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15'>15</a></span>
have lost in his previous transaction; but the dates,
of a delicate amber color, as sweet as honey and
almost as transparent, were worth whatever price
we paid for them.
</p>

<p>
After much turning and retracing of steps, and
laughing over being lost and not having the power
to make inquiries with any certainty of being understood,
we finally gained wider and more open streets,
and on the Piazza Banchi found an exchange, where
we were able to get some money on our letters of
credit.
</p>

<p>
After attending to this practical detail we turned
into the little old Via Orefici, Jewellers' Street, with
its many goldsmiths' shops. Over one of the doors is
a Virgin and Child, so beautiful that it cost the
artist his life. Pellegrino Piola's master, insanely
jealous of this work of his pupil, rose up in wrath and
killed him. Even the patron, St. Eloy, was unable to
save poor Piola's life, but the guild of smiths, who
revere St. Eloy as their patron saint, invoked his aid
to preserve this lovely fresco from the ruthless hands
of Napoleon when he would have carried it off to
France.
</p>

<p>
As we passed window after window, some with
their display of exquisite gold and silver filigree and
others containing lofty pyramids of the most delicious-looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16'>16</a></span>
candied fruit, Angela said that after a
few hours' stay in Genoa she was quite sure of two
characteristics of the Genoese: a passion for jewelry,
especially of the filigree sort, and an inordinate
appetite for sweets. The pretty, delicate ornaments,
I am inclined to think, are only spread forth to tempt
the unwary tourist; but the Italian taste for sweets
is proverbial, whetted, doubtless, by the high price
of sugar and the exquisiteness of the native confections.
</p>

<p>
Strolling along the fine, wide Via Vittorio Emanuele,
eating our dates like true Bohemians and gazing
about us upon the sights of the strange city, we
turned, almost involuntarily, into the busy thoroughfare
of the Via San Lorenzo, where we were confronted
by the great façade of the cathedral of the
same name, with huge stone lions standing guard
at the door. Above the entrance&mdash;grewsome and
realistic spectacle&mdash;is poor St. Lawrence broiling
away on his stone gridiron! We shall doubtless
behold many such spectacles during our travels,
and may, like Mark Twain, become quite hardened
to the sight of St. Sebastian stuck full of arrows,
and of lovely young St. Anastasia and of many
others, of whom the world was not worthy, smiling
amid the flames; but this realistic thrusting of St.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17'>17</a></span>
Lawrence and his gridiron into the life of to-day,
as an ornament to a church, impressed us as unworthy
of a people credited with a sense of beauty
and fitness.
</p>

<p>
We were thankful to turn from the cathedral,
whose interior we may explore to-morrow, and, like
good Americans, wend our way along the Via Balbi,
with its many palaces and handsome university buildings,
to a lovely little square called Acquaverde, where
there is a handsome modern statue of Columbus.
Beside the really fine figure of the Genoese navigator
is a woman who represents either Columbia or an
Italianized American Indian, we were not sure which,
to whom Columbus is offering the Catholic religion
and other blessings of civilization. From the benevolent
expression of the donor it is evident that he
is making the presentation in good faith, although the
lady appears singularly indifferent to the gifts offered
her.
</p>

<p>
Some children with large, dark eyes and round,
rosy cheeks, beautiful enough to serve as models for
the Holy Child and St. John, were playing in the
little green square some rhymed game in which their
high, clear voices rang out joyously. It was probably
an Italian equivalent for "ring-around-the-rosy" or
"hot butter-beans." We longed to know just what
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18'>18</a></span>
the words meant. Zelphine bribed the singers with
soldi to an encore; but, alas! the song fell upon ears
dull of understanding. This was the merriest scene
that we have found in Genoa, which does not impress
us as a gay city at all; but what mature and sane
community could be merry under skies as leaden as
these?
</p>

<p>
We are lodged in an old palace, which opens out on
those most disappointing arcades of which we have
read such fascinating descriptions. We see no pretty
young Genoese women in thin muslin veils nor handsome
matrons in veils of flowered chintz; probably the
rain keeps them and their finery indoors. We remind
ourselves, from time to time, that we are dwelling
in marble halls for the first time in our lives, and
yet some of the appointments of this rather expensive
<i>albergo</i> are not equal to those of a second or third
class hotel in America. My room is spacious, with
windows opening to the floor and commanding a fine
view of the harbor, where many ships lie at anchor,
among them the floating city in which we came hither.
It makes us feel at home to-night to see the lights
of the Augusta Victoria, and we wave friendly greetings
to her and our fellow-voyagers across the bay.
</p>

<p>
"We were far more comfortable in our little state-rooms
on the ship than we shall ever be in this damp
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19'>19</a></span>
palace!" said Angela, shivering. "This room feels
like a cellar. Do they never have any fires here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, behold the fireplace!" I replied, drawing
aside a screen and revealing a small hole in the wall.
"We will bask in the warmth of a cheerful blaze this
evening, and toast our toes before the glowing coals."
</p>

<p>
As luck would have it, the chimney did not draw
well, probably not having been used in this century,
and so instead of a cheerful blaze we had clouds of
smoke, and went to bed to dream of snow-storms and
icebergs.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
February 20th.
</p>

<p>
I awoke to hear the rain beating against my window
and Angela's merry voice at my side, saying, "Such
an experience! Zelphine rang our bell, thinking that
she would have a fire or smoke or something to take
off the deadly chill from our room. In a minute there
came a knock at the door, and instead of the chambermaid
there stood a grand gentleman in a blue coat and
brass buttons, with a breakfast-tray&mdash;the proprietor
or head waiter, I should say. We hadn't the courage
to say a word about fire to this dignified person. Indeed,
he gave us no time to say anything, as he set the
tray on a table beside the bed, and vanished with
'Madame est servie.' Of course Z. is the madame;
I don't count, being <i>jeune fille</i>. Such manners Z. says
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20'>20</a></span>
she has seldom seen in a ballroom at home. So now,
Margaret, the breakfast is there and must be eaten.
Do order yours, and let us breakfast together."
</p>

<p>
"A kimono <i>déjeuner à trois</i>," I said, laughing
over Angela's ignorance of Continental ways, to
which I had become quite accustomed during my art
winter in Paris with Katharine Clarke.
</p>

<p>
"A second ring may fetch the maid and fire," said
Angela, pressing the button.
</p>

<p>
This, however, only served to bring the blue-coated
waiter, with another tray of coffee and rolls. It was
some time before we were able to get the maid, who,
in turn, sent for the <i>facchino</i> who attends to the
fires, and he, assisted by another <i>facchino</i>, finally
succeeded in fanning into a blaze the infinitesimal
quantity of wood used here for a fire. This "house
that Jack built" distribution of labor is rather puzzling
to the uninitiated. We are wondering how we
shall ever compass the problem of fees, so many
people are serving us.
</p>

<p>
"I don't wonder that Eugene Field sang with
longing of the 'land of stoves and sunshine,'" said
Zelphine, as she held her hands over the feeble flame,
"if he ever stayed in Genoa in February."
</p>

<p>
This is the nearest approach to a complaint that
Zelphine has uttered since we left New York. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21'>21</a></span>
accepts everything that comes to us, good, bad, or
indifferent, as a part of the game. We breakfasted
heartily, calling for more rolls and boiled eggs, to
the evident but entirely well-bred astonishment of
the presiding genius, who was not accustomed to such
early morning appetites.
</p>

<p>
The rain continued to pour in torrents; and here
let me confess, with more or less contrition, that we
were all three most desperately homesick. Whether
it was that we missed our pleasant fellow-travellers
who were steaming off for Nice to-day, or because of
the persistent rain, we, one after another, fell a prey
to the depressing malady. Angela, first of all, with
eyes full of tears, wondered many times, in language
more or less strenuous, why she had ever left her
happy home for these inhospitable shores; and I&mdash;well,
it matters little what I said. Zelphine surprised
me weeping over my travelling-hat, which, although
it did present a rather dilapidated appearance after
yesterday's rain, failed to afford sufficient cause for
my tears. She, the heroic one, who had never told her
woe, in attempting to console me broke down herself,
and we wept in each other's arms, which had the
good result of bringing Angela to our side and making
her laugh heartily. Finally, in desperation, I
proposed that we should order a cab and drive over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22'>22</a></span>
to the Hôtel de Londres and try to find some of our
steamer friends who expected to stay here a few days
<i>en route</i> for Florence.
</p>

<p>
We were cordially welcomed by Bertha Linn and
Mrs. Robins, who received us in their rooms, one of
which was comfortably heated by a porcelain stove.
Despite their more favorable surroundings, we soon
discovered that our two countrywomen were as down-hearted
as ourselves. Bertha, seated upon a trunk,
looking about as cheerful as Miss Betsey Trotwood
when she came up to London in pursuit of her scattered
fortune, expressed herself to the effect that
foreign travel might be of advantage educationally
and enlarging to the mind, but for her part she preferred
her own country, and would gladly take the
next steamer back to New York. Angela heartily
agreed with Bertha, while Zelphine begged her to
remember the enchanting days we had spent in Madeira
and Granada, and that even more delightful experiences
lay before us, assuring them that Italy is
not a proverbially rainy country, et cetera; in the
midst of which profitable conversation Mrs. Robins
suggested that we should take cabs and drive to the
Campo Santo, by way of a diversion.
</p>

<p>
"We certainly are in a proper frame of mind for
a visit to a cemetery," said Angela, laughing a cheerless
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23'>23</a></span>
laugh, with a minor chord in it suggestive of
tears near the surface.
</p>

<p>
No place could be more admirably adapted for a
rainy day excursion than the Campo Santo of Genoa,
as that vast cemetery is nearly all under cover. Our
first impression of the long galleries with their monuments
and low reliefs, many of them decorated with
photographs of the dead and overhung with the tasteless
wreaths of tin flowers dear to the Continental
mourner, was of something hopelessly inartistic and
artificial. Among the many shockingly realistic and
inappropriate monuments we found a few simple and
beautiful statues and low reliefs. You remember how
many of the monuments in Westminster Abbey are
in bad taste and overweighted with carved ornaments;
the majority of these are not less artistic, but one has
a right to expect more beauty and grace in Italy than
in England, and then the grand old abbey lends a
certain dignity to everything within its walls. The
Campo Santo looks more like a picture-gallery than a
necropolis; but <i>chacun à son goût</i>. This is evidently
the <i>goût</i> of the Genoese, and the name of their cemetery
is so beautiful that I, for one, am inclined to
overlook lack of taste in other matters.
</p>

<p>
The tomb of the patriot Giuseppe Mazzini is in
this Campo Santo, above the rotunda and over against
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24'>24</a></span>
the steep hillside. It did not impress us particularly;
but we found ourselves turning again and again to
the figure of an old woman in a fine brocade gown,
with a ring of bread, which here they call <i>pain de la
couronne</i>, over her arm, and what seemed to be strings
of large pearls depending from her waist.
</p>

<p>
"It is evidently the statue of some great lady who
sold her pearls to raise money to feed the poor,"
said Zelphine. "Here are the pearls, and she carries
the bread on her arm just as the peasants do in Spain
and in all these southern countries. I wish we could
find the story somewhere and the lady's name. This
statue may have been erected by a grateful people in
recognition of her generous aid."
</p>

<p>
"She certainly has the face and bearing of a peasant,
rather than of a grand lady," said Bertha.
</p>

<p>
Just then we heard a low, infectious laugh behind
us, and turned to find General W., one of our ship's
company, who was evidently much amused by our
discussion, and made haste to tear Zelphine's romance
into shreds by explaining that her Lady Bountiful
was a peasant woman who made quite a sum of money
by selling bread and nuts on the streets of Genoa.
Having an ambition to rest with the rich and great
in the Campo Santo, under a fine monument, she
bought the right to be buried here for three thousand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25'>25</a></span>
francs, and had the pleasure of ordering her own
monument, for which she paid six thousand francs.
Nine thousand francs, in all, for glory&mdash;quite a
fortune for a peasant!
</p>

<p>
"The pearls are only nuts, after all!" exclaimed
Zelphine, "and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The cake is dough," said Bertha, laughing; "but
it is all very interesting as a study in human nature.
I don't doubt the poor woman found great satisfaction
in looking at this fine figure of herself."
</p>

<p>
"She did not have even that satisfaction," replied
General W., "for she died soon after she had ordered
it, in a street brawl or something of the sort. <i>Sic
transit gloria mundi.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"How you do break down our images and bowl
over our idols!" exclaimed Angela.
</p>

<p>
We had dismissed our cabs on entering the Campo
Santo, and, as the rain had ceased for the time, we
returned by the electric tram of the Via di Circonvallazione
a Mare, which runs close to the sea, and
which, as Angela says, besides circumambulating the
city, is a clever way of circumventing the cabman.
Our homesickness had disappeared amid the shades
of the departed, and, a merry party, we made our
way to the Concordia, that most delightful garden-café.
Here we lunched upon <i>risotto</i> (rice made yellow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26'>26</a></span>
with saffron), spaghetti, and other Italian dishes,
with an accompaniment of bread in small sticks, crisp
and brown.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
February 21st.
</p>

<p>
A note has just come from your cousin, Genevra
Fuller, urging us to make her a visit at her home in
San Remo. This invitation, which is most cordial,
is a temptation to us all, but Zelphine and Angela
have promised to spend their time with friends in
Nice, stopping for a day at Monte Carlo, if their
sporting tastes lead them so far afield, while I yield
to Genevra's blandishments. You know of old that
she is not a person to be lightly refused when she has
set her heart upon any given thing&mdash;a family trait, I
believe.

<h2>
II
<br />

ALONG THE RIVIERA
</h2>
<hr class="l30" />

<p class="ralign">
February 22d.
</p>

<p>
Of course the sun was shining when we left Genoa.
We were glad to see how fair La Superba could be,
with her terraced gardens, many villas, and noble
background of blue mountains. Indeed, I confess to
some qualms of conscience, feeling that I may have
given you a too gloomy picture of the fine old city;
but how can one give a cheerful view of the attractions
of a place where one's gayest hours were spent in a
cemetery?
</p>

<p>
Our way lay along the sea by the Western Riviera,
one of the garden spots of the world. The railroad
winds in and out among the rocks, or into tunnels
pierced through them, often running parallel with the
famous Cornice Drive, which was for many years the
only road from Genoa to Nice. The beauty of this
drive, which lies sometimes between the railroad and
the sea and again ascends the rocky heights beyond,
made us wish that railroads had never been invented.
A coach and four, a Cinderella coach, would be the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28'>28</a></span>
only suitable equipage in which to make this journey
into fairyland.
</p>

<p>
"Why did we not drive?" I hear you ask, and you
may well ask. Because the railroad, dashing in and
out of tunnels, often crosses the drive most unexpectedly
and on the grade. Even Zelphine, much as
she wished to drive over the self-same road taken by
her dear Lucy in "Doctor Antonio," hesitated about
imperilling her neck, and I was quite resolute upon
this point. And if Zelphine and I were so reckless as
to be willing to risk our own lives, have we not under
our care the only and well-beloved daughter of the
ancient and honorable house of Haldane?
</p>

<p>
Did I say that the train dashed? Really, that was a
slip of the pen&mdash;nothing dashes in Italy except a
mountain torrent; but where there are so many grade
crossings, even a slow train may be dangerous. We
proceeded moderately and sedately upon our shining
way, skirting the sapphire sea, dotted here and there
with green islands. Reaching far out into the blue,
one may see small towns which seem bent upon washing
their white houses to a more dazzling whiteness in
the clear water, painted towns against a painted sea
and sky. Other hamlets and villas, with their green
jalousies and their luxuriant gardens full of flowers
and orange-trees, are on the heights above, and not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29'>29</a></span>
seldom a solitary sanctuary is seen, perched upon
some sea-washed cliff, the cherished guardian of the
shore.
</p>

<p>
Now indeed, looking up at the terraced olive-groves,
we feel that we are in Italy. For many miles the
road lies beside these gardens, which are monuments
to Italian thrift and industry, as every square inch
of the scanty earth on the hillsides is held in place by
stone walls, one above another, until some are almost
mountain high, olive-trees growing to the very top.
On the sunny plains between the hills are acres of carnations,
violets, stock-gillies, and mignonette, which
fill the air with their delicious fragrance. From these
immense gardens the large cities are supplied with
flowers, and also the manufactories of perfumes.
Hundreds of the beautiful blossoms, they tell us, are
sacrificed to make a single drop of essence.
</p>

<p>
We passed by Albenga and Alassio, over the suspension
bridge at Porto Maurizio, and so on to Taggia,
which is near San Remo, where we three were to
part company for a few days. Off to the right we
could see the picturesque ruins of Bussana Vecchia,
destroyed by an earthquake as late as 1887, never
rebuilt, and now standing silent and desolate on the
hill-top above its namesake, the little modern town of
Bussana Nuova.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30'>30</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Our view of Poggio and Bussana Vecchia was suddenly
cut off by an inopportune tunnel, from which
we emerged into the brilliant sunshine, to see before
us the pretty villas, the waving palms, and the general
air of cultivation and <i>bien-être</i> that belong to this
favorite and highly favored town. When Zelphine and
Angela caught this glimpse of San Remo from the
train, and saw Genevra's children waiting for me at
the station, I am quite sure they repented them of
their decision.
</p>

<p>
I had not seen Roger and Ph&oelig;be since they were
babies, but I knew them at once, and we are already
fast friends. Genevra's welcome, as you may believe,
was of the warmest. It is delightful to be in a home
again, after tossing about in a state-room and knocking
around in strange hotels, and in a home as charming
as this!
</p>

<p class="ralign">
February 25th.
</p>

<p>
Everything is delightfully foreign in this <i>ménage</i>;
Genevra lives in an apartment, as most people do here;
hers is on the second floor, with a huge salon on
one side of the hall, a <i>salle à manger</i> on the other,
and the usual complement of bedrooms, kitchens, and
the like. This is quite different from anything we
have in America, where the apartments are on a scale
of princely magnificence, with prices to match, or of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31'>31</a></span>
a simplicity so extreme that "flat" seems to designate
appropriately both them and the condition of those
who inhabit them. This apartment is really a house
on one floor; the entrance and stone stairway are quite
palatial, and yet it is <i>à bon marché</i>. The drawing-room
is spacious, with windows to the floor, opening
out on balconies on which we step out to see the <i>bersaglieri</i>
drill in the evenings, as the children are on
the qui vive from the moment the spirited music
reaches their ears.
</p>

<p>
Genevra's large salon is heated by an open fire of
olive-wood, which she says makes it warm enough
except when the winters are unusually cold. The
English ladies who come to tea in the afternoon throw
aside their wraps, exclaiming, "Ah, Mrs. Fuller's
drawing-room is always so very hot!"
</p>

<p>
Hot is not exactly the word that I should apply to
dear Genevra's pretty drawing-room, although I know
that Lucie and Marthe are piling on extra wood all
the time in compliment to Mademoiselle, the shivering
American.
</p>

<p>
Everything in this house moves with a delightful
smoothness and ease, and the whole atmosphere of the
place is indescribably restful. When I awake in the
morning I touch a bell, which soon brings to my
bedside the trim, neat-handed Lucie with rolls and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32'>32</a></span>
coffee. This morning my breakfast-tray was glorified
with great bunches of dark purple and light Neapolitan
violets.
</p>

<p>
"What is the meaning of this reckless extravagance?"
I call out to Genevra, whose room is next to
mine.
</p>

<p>
"Extravagance, <i>ma belle</i>!" replies Genevra.
"Flowers are one of the economies of San Remo. If
I were to carpet your path with violets it would be a
cheap pleasure for me at the rate of two soldi a
bunch!" Wasn't that like Genevra?&mdash;like the old
Genevra, yet with a certain grace learned from these
charming Italians! Only half believing her, and yet
comforted by her assurances, I enjoy the delicious fragrance
of the violets while I luxuriously sip my coffee
and read the opening pages of Ruffini's "Doctor
Antonio."
</p>

<p>
Yesterday we drove to Bordighera, and Genevra
and I tried to find the place near Ospedaletti where
Sir John Davenne's coach came to grief by the roadside.
It was disappointing to find no trace of Rosa's
little inn, only great hotels, a casino, and all manner
of extravagant and unromantic modern innovations.
The sea and the picturesque coast are fortunately the
same, and Genevra pointed out to me the great rock
near which Battista rowed Lucy's boat while Antonio
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33'>33</a></span>
told Sir John how cleverly the valiant citizens of
Bordighera had here outwitted the British in their
brig-of-war. And on this road the Doctor walked
home by moonlight, after an evening with Sir John
and Lucy, singing "O bell' alma innamorata!" Poor,
dear, brave Antonio&mdash;love, dear love, treated him
shabbily enough! Your mother will remember reading
this story to me on one of my early visits to Woodford.
Although I was but a child then, my wrath
rose hot against Lucy's treatment of Antonio. After
her marriage with Lord Cleverton I refused to listen
to another word about the faithless Lucy, until curiosity
and a real fondness for the pretty blonde heroine
sent me back to this saddest of stories, over which
I wept as girls of an earlier time wept over "The
Sorrows of Werther."
</p>

<p>
This digression is all apropos of Bordighera, which is
most interesting aside from its associations with Lucy
and her lover, with its enchanting Coast Promenade
ending at the Spianata del Capo. From this promontory
there is a noble view of Ventimiglia, Mentone,
Monaco, Villafranca and its light-house; beyond is
the long, low line of the French shore, and still beyond,
the Maritime Alps, with flecks of snow upon their
sides, while near us, at our feet, lies the bay of
Ospedaletti, sparkling in the sun. Bordighera is literally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34'>34</a></span>
framed in by palm-trees&mdash;palms to right, to
left, everywhere. No wonder that this little town
long had the exclusive honor of supplying the palms
to St. Peter's in Rome for Palm Sunday; but thereby
hangs a tale which I may not relate to-day, as Genevra
bids me drop my pen and join her and her friends
over a cup of tea.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
February 26th.
</p>

<p>
The days pass all too quickly in this charming place.
My mornings are generally spent in walking&mdash;sometimes
on the Promenade du Midi, which lies near the
sea, a beautiful, palm-bordered terrace above the beach&mdash;or
in wandering through the old quarter of San
Remo, with Roger and Ph&oelig;be by my side. Here are
narrow, precipitous streets like those of Genoa, in
strong contrast with the gay walk by the sea, which
has all the characteristics of a foreign watering-place.
The <i>vive la bagatelle</i> existence of the Promenade du
Midi is not without its charm once in a while, but in
the winding streets of the old town is the typical life
of San Remo.
</p>

<p>
We watch the vendors of fruit, vegetables, nuts, and
herbs displaying their simple wares upon the sidewalk,
or stroll down by the bank where the washing
is done, picturesquely, if somewhat laboriously, in the
open. The <i>lavandaie</i> are, most of them, vigorous young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35'>35</a></span>
creatures, and as they beat the clothes against the
stones or rinse them in the clear, running water, their
merry chatter and laughter suggest social joys even
beyond those of our voluble Bridgets at home.
</p>

<p>
Your mother's favorite saw about the back being
fitted to the burden often recurs to me here. If these
peasants are poor, their wants are few, they live in a
divine climate, the whole of the out-of-doors is theirs,
and, above all, they have dispositions and digestions
that may well cause them to be envied of princes.
Dr. A., Genevra's physician, tells me that the peasants
here are usually healthy and the children as robust as
they are handsome. This Italian gentleman is one
of the interesting characters of San Remo. I always
feel like calling him Doctor Antonio, for although Dr.
A. has travelled extensively, and speaks English perfectly,
he is quite Italian in appearance and manner,
and so loyally devoted to his Italy that I am quite
sure he would have sacrificed life and fortune to her
cause had he lived in the stirring times that developed
Ruffini's heroic Doctor Antonio.
</p>

<p>
On Sunday afternoon Roger and Ph&oelig;be drove me up
to the little sanctuary of the Madonna della Guardia.
Our road crossed that leading to Bussana Vecchia,
which picturesque ruin attracts me by its mystery and
its remoteness from the life of to-day. If you were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36'>36</a></span>
here you would certainly explore the remains of this
old town, and perhaps you would take me with you
through its silent streets. Just now fate seems to be
against my seeing it. On Saturday, when we were
all ready to set forth, the rain fell in torrents, and
on Sunday there was no time to stop on our way to
Capo Verde, so Bussana Vecchia seems destined to be
my "Carcassonne."
</p>

<p>
The little sanctuary of the Madonna della Guardia is
built, like the home of the wise man of the Scriptures,
upon a rock, crowning the promontory of Capo Verde.
From the heights there is a fine panorama, as they say
here, of sea and shore; Taggia and Poggio were at
our feet as we stood on the shelving rock, which overhangs
a sheer declivity of many feet. In the church
there is a collection of curious pictures, votive offerings,
representing men and women in the midst of
deadly peril by field and flood: fishermen in boats
tossing upon stormy seas, and carriage-loads of pleasure-seekers
pitching down precipices or dashing along
the road at the mercy of steeds as wild as that of
Mazeppa. All of these good people, as appears from
the expressions of gratitude recorded in the several
paintings, were saved from sudden and horrible death
by the powerful intervention of the gentle Mother of
Sorrows and Mercies.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37'>37</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I am finishing this letter while Genevra sings to the
children their good-night songs and tucks them into
their beds. To-morrow will be a full day, with some
commissions to be attended to at the shops, which are
tempting here, two or three visits, and an afternoon
tea with some charming Scotch ladies at the Hôtel de
Londres. The day following I leave here for Nice,
having decided to meet Zelphine and Angela there
instead of at Genoa as I had intended. This change
of plan is made in order that we may take the famous
drive from Nice to Genoa, which Dr. A. assures me
is not as dangerous as it appears, and in beauty more
nearly approaches the description of Paradise than
anything else to be seen upon earthly shores. If we
make the trip in an automobile, which we shall probably
do, we shall have a couple of hours to spend here
with Genevra <i>en route</i> for Genoa, which anticipation
helps to console her for her disappointment in losing
two days of my visit. She will then be able to judge
for herself whether Angela is as pretty as I have
described her and whether Zelphine is as charming
with white hair as with brown, questions that may
seem of little moment to the masculine mind, but are
deeply interesting to Genevra. She will be calling
me soon to join her at what Macaulay calls "the
curling hour," which we count the best in the twenty-four.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38'>38</a></span>
Lucie heaps up the olive-wood on the hearth
until it blazes brightly, and places a tray with chocolate
before us. Thus cheered and sustained we gossip
into "the wee, sma' hours." Genevra asks so many
questions about her old friends that we should have to
talk until the cocks crow if I were to answer them all.
By the way, do your ears ever burn these nights about
twelve o' the clock? She often talks of you, asks if
you have grown more sedate with added years and dignities,
whether you have lost your habit of jesting,
and speaks of a certain merry twinkle in the corner of
your eye which used to betray you when mischief was
brewing&mdash;on the whole Genevra cherishes a very
cousinly affection for your lordship. There! she is
calling me, so

<br />

CAPTURED BY A CABMAN
</h2>
<hr class="l30" />

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Naples</span>, March 2d.
</p>

<p>
If Lady Morgan wrote of her beloved Irish capital
"dear, dirty Dublin," we may describe Naples less
alliteratively in somewhat the same words, except
that to American eyes the Neapolitan city is even
dirtier and vastly more beautiful. Indeed, no words
written nor pictures painted give any adequate conception
of the blueness of the sea, the soft purple
shades upon the mountains, and the fine transparency
and lightness of this air. One breathes in gayety with
every breath, a certain elasticity and <i>joie de vivre</i>
which the filth, the noise, the bad odors, and even the
hopeless poverty all around us are powerless to dispel.
</p>

<p>
From the Strada Vittorio Emanuele, where we are
stopping, we look down upon a series of terraced
gardens, some of them very poor little gardens with a
few vegetables, among them the omnipresent and
much beloved artichoke, the fennel, like a coarse
celery, and lettuce. Roses are climbing all over the
walls of these hillside gardens, and in many of them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40'>40</a></span>
orange-trees are blooming, spreading around them a
delicious perfume. Here on the heights we have none
of the disadvantages of Naples, the noise, the unsavory
odors, or the uncleanliness.
</p>

<p>
Above this <i>strada</i>, which is the name by which the
Neapolitans call their streets, the hills tower for
many feet, and way up on their crests are the Castle
of St. Elmo and the old Carthusian monastery of San
Martino. We visited San Martino the day after our
arrival, because Zelphine had an irrepressible desire
to get to the tip-top of everything and view both the
city and bay from the heights above us. The ascent
was made in one of the <i>funicolari</i>, cable trams, which
are used so much over here. They are rather terrifying
at first, but are said to be quite safe, and are, I
believe, less dangerous than many of our elevators.
</p>

<p class="caption"><span class='smcap'>The Bay of Naples</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The old monastery is now a museum, under the
management of the Museo Nazionale, and contains
many paintings, porcelains, carvings, and other
antiques. We neglected the treasures within for the
greater pleasure of wandering at will through the
charming, picturesque cloisters, which are richly
carved and of a stone warm and creamy in tone, so
different from the heavy, dark cloisters one sees in
England and elsewhere. Most of our morning was
spent basking in the sunshine of the court; we could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41'>41</a></span>
fancy the old monks enjoying, as we did, the genial
warmth that in the Southern Italian winter is only
to be found out of doors. The museum itself was
damp, as are all the galleries at this season.
</p>

<p>
In this court are a number of handsome sarcophagi,
with inscriptions and coats-of-arms carved in the marble;
from hence we passed into the Belvedere, whose balconies
command an exquisite view of the city and bay.
We gazed long at the noble panorama spread before
us, from Posilipo to the hill of Capodimonte. Over
across the bay were Ischia and Capri, blue as its
own grotto, with Sorrento's long point of land reaching
out into the sea, and off in the far distance the snow-line
of the Apennines. To our left, Vesuvius, with
its three peaks, was smoking away as peacefully as
a Hollander on his <i>hooge stoep</i>. Seeing them by day
it is hard to believe that these fair blue hills could
have wrought sudden destruction upon the cities of
the plain; but last night, when flames flashed up skyward
from the smoking crater, I must confess that we
had some misgivings. When we beheld these danger-signals,
as they seemed to us, we carried our fears and
our queries to the <i>padrone</i> and the concierge, who both
assured us, to their own satisfaction if not entirely
to ours, that Vesuvius has never erupted in the direction
of Naples, evidently feeling that Italian volcanoes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42'>42</a></span>
like Italian people, are not in the habit of changing
their ways.
</p>

<p>
Standing upon the Belvedere of San Martino, we
were able to form some idea of the great width of the
bay, where just now "William's yacht," as one
of our English friends always calls it, is riding at
anchor. The Kaiser is making one of his rapid, semi-official,
quite friendly, and wholly diplomatic visits to
Rome, and his yacht awaits him here.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
March 4th.
</p>

<p>
We have spent the morning at the National Museum,
where are so many of the world-famous sculptures,
the Hercules, a magnificent, strong figure in
perfect repose, a giant taking his ease, and the
Farnese Bull, both of them from the Baths of Caracalla
in Rome, and a huge bronze horse from Herculaneum.
Most impressive and interesting to us is
the statue of Diana of the Ephesians, against whose
worship Paul preached at Ephesus. A curious statue
is this, odd enough to have fallen down from Jupiter,
according to the tradition, or from any other heathen
god! The torso is of fine, variegated marble, and the
head, hands, and feet, the latter slender and delicate,
are of bronze. This Diana is not a huntress, like the
Greek Artemis with the crescent above her brow, but
bears about her the symbols of abundance. We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43'>43</a></span>
lingered long near this statue of the great goddess of
the Ephesians, marvelling wherein lay the secret of
her power. To Demetrius and the other silversmiths
who made her shrines she was valuable, as she brought
them great gain; but for beauty or grace there was
no reason why this Diana should have been worshipped
by "Asia and all the world."
</p>

<p>
Among the bronzes from Pompeii and Herculaneum
we found the originals of many of the exquisitely
graceful figures with which we are all familiar. We
greeted as old friends the Dancing Faun, the Mercury,
the Flying Victory, the Wrestlers, Silenus, the
Boy with the Dolphin, and, above all, the lovely Narcissus,
which they now call by another name. Zelphine and
I have decided that we will never acknowledge this
to be a Dionysus or anything less poetic than the
Narcissus. This charming, youthful figure with the
bent head and listening ear is quite small, not nearly
life-size, and for that reason, perhaps, its beauty is
more delicate and spiritual. If that little figure could
speak, what could it not tell of pomp, luxury, love,
and delight, all overtaken and overwhelmed by sudden
destruction in the buried city where it was found!
</p>

<p>
Now, indeed, if it were in my power to rhyme four
lines and make sense at the same time, which was my
school-girl idea of poetry-making, I should certainly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44'>44</a></span>
be sending you a poem about the Narcissus; but why
cudgel my brains when Keats has, with his own sympathetic
charm, told the pathetic story of the beautiful
youth?&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">
"Who gazed into the stream's deep recess
</p>
<p class="i1">
And died of his own dear loveliness."
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
On our way home from the museum our <i>vetturino</i>
beat his horse so unmercifully, although the poor nag
was going as fast as a horse could be expected to go
up hill, that Zelphine remonstrated with him, very
tactfully, as I thought, paying his sorry Rosinante
compliments and calling the wretched beast <i>il buono
cavallo</i>. The idea of any one feeling compassion for
a horse evidently touched the driver's sense of humor,
and, regarding it as a huge joke, he laughed and
whipped the poor animal still more unmercifully,
making us understand, in the gibberish of French and
Italian peculiar to the cabmen here, that there was
no need to be merciful to a creature without a soul.
We longed for greater facility in some language that
he could understand, to inquire into his own spiritual
condition. As, however, words were wanting, we
fell to wondering wherein such a being as this differs
from the beasts of the field. The cabmen of Naples
would certainly afford our friend Dr. C. an additional
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45'>45</a></span>
argument in favor of his pet doctrine of
conditional immortality.
</p>

<p>
Our driver's attitude toward the animal creation is,
we are told, that of most Neapolitans. Even persons
of more intelligence question the advisability of caring
for the comfort of dumb creatures, yet these
apparently cruel people have a most kindly custom.
If parents lose a child, and children are generally
so numerous that it seems as if one could scarcely be
missed, they adopt an orphan, call it God's child, and
treat it as their own.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
March 6th.
</p>

<p>
We have been wondering, ever since we came here,
where the beauty and fashion of Naples are to be
found, having seen on the streets only tradespeople
and beggars. We put the question to our friend the
concierge at the Hotel B. At five o'clock in the
afternoon, he told us, the <i>beau monde</i> could be seen
taking an airing on the Chiaia, never earlier. It
seems that Neapolitans of quality do not drive while
the sun is shining. You remember that old Italian
proverb about only dogs and Englishmen liking the
sun? To this I would add the wise peasants, with
whom its genial warmth takes the place of food,
fire, and proper clothing.
</p>

<p>
Five o'clock on a March afternoon is a rather chilly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46'>46</a></span>
and uncomfortable hour for a drive; but we should
have to go then or give up all idea of a fashionable
<i>promenade en voiture</i> with the élite of Naples. This
afternoon was the time arranged for our drive. A
<i>carrozza</i>, a two-horse carriage, was to meet us at a
favorite coral shop on the Chiaia, whose exquisite
wares draw Angela daily with a glittering eye. Having
arranged with Zelphine about this rendezvous, I
left her hanging over some Pompeian statuettes in a
shop on the Toledo, copies, of course, but very good
ones, quite too tempting to be safely dallied with, and
made my way to Thomas Cook's office and to several
glove shops. When my commissions were finished,
I had more than an hour on my hands, so I lingered
for some time before the tall monument in the Square
of the Martyrs, a memorial to the patriots who perished
during several Neapolitan revolutions. This
monument has much of the simplicity and strength of
the Nelson memorial on Trafalgar Square, having like
it four colossal bronze lions at the base. The noble
shaft is surmounted by one of Caggiani's graceful
figures, a Victory delicately poised as if on tiptoe
for a flight.
</p>

<p>
After gazing long at the beautiful monument, I
strolled down the Strada Chiaia to the esplanade with
the statues and fountains, a charming place to walk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47'>47</a></span>
on a cool afternoon. You know my fancy for wandering
alone through strange streets and byways. On and
on I sauntered, thinking that I might have time to
walk as far as the Aquarium before keeping my tryst
at the coral shop, and not fully realizing how deserted
the place was until I heard a penetrating voice quite
close to me speaking rapid and almost unintelligible
French, accompanied by the cracking of a whip. "A
cabman&mdash;I'll pay no attention to him," I said to
myself; "he'll be discouraged after a while and
leave me." I soon found that I had reckoned without
my host: that vociferous, whip-cracking Jehu
followed me, dogged my steps, offered me his cab at
absurdly low rates, and finally cornered me in a recess
of one of the large public buildings. I looked around;
there was not a person in sight to help me, only a few
beggars on the steps, who would naturally make common
cause with the cabman. You will laugh at me, I
am sure, but so terrified was I by the creature's
language and gestures and whip-cracking that I
abjectly stepped into his cab, telling him to drive me
for an hour and set me down at the well-known coral
shop on the Chiaia at five o'clock, showing him the
time on my watch-face. Was I not just a bit like the
woman who married a persistent suitor in order to get
rid of him? Her troubles probably began then and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48'>48</a></span>
there; mine certainly did. My <i>cocher</i>, with an irritating
expression of triumph on his face, set forth upon a
tour of sight-seeing which threatened to be of long
duration. We passed from street to street, from building
to building, until to my dismay I found that he was
driving toward the upper town. I protested, knowing
that there would not be time to get back to the Chiaia
by five o'clock. Would I like to see San Martino? No,
I answered, with decision, I had already been to San
Martino; I wished to go back to the Chiaia. Then&mdash;for
astuteness commend me to a Neapolitan <i>vetturino</i>&mdash;that
irritating creature became suddenly deaf,
dumb, and blind, while his horse went on and on up
the heights toward San Martino. Fortunately, the
road winds around the hill, and as we reached one
of its windings I saw, by a sign, that we were on the
Strada Vittorio Emanuele. Hope revived when I began
to recognize familiar buildings; we would soon
reach our hotel. "Hotel B.! Albergo B.!" I cried,
with so much insistence and with gestures so like his
own that the creature finally listened to me, the horse
slackened its pace slightly, and then, oh joy! the Hotel
B. appeared, the concierge at the door. I called to
him, he made a peremptory sign to the driver to stop,
and I was once again a free woman, standing on my
two feet, with solid ground beneath them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49'>49</a></span>
</p>

<p>
My Jehu now regained the use of his tongue, and
unblushingly insisted upon a two hours' fee for the
drive of a trifle over an hour which I had been coerced
into taking. The sum was not extortionate, according
to American ideas, but no one wishes to be cheated,
especially with one's eyes wide open. I protested,
explained the state of affairs to the concierge, when, to
my surprise, he, my ally and champion as I had
thought him, deserted me at this critical moment and
joined the enemy, saying, "The signorina would do
well to pay the <i>vetturino</i> what he asks, as according
to the signorina's own watch she has had the cab
over an hour."
</p>

<p>
My humiliation was great when I handed the
triumphant cabman his ill-gotten gains, but greater
still was my disappointment over the defection of the
concierge, whom we have all trusted. It seems, indeed,
as if every man's hand is against us in this
beautiful city, from the salesman who tries to sell us
imperfect coral to the crafty vendor of fruit who slips
bad oranges into a paper bag for us, while he tries to
distract our attention by sentimental remarks on the
weather and the "bella vista."
</p>

<p>
Rather than trust myself to the mercy of another
cabman, I ignominiously made my way down the
many steps of the terrace to the street below, where I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50'>50</a></span>
took a tram to the Chiaia. Angela was seated in
the carriage, looking around anxiously, while Zelphine
was walking up and down the pavement, both evidently
much disturbed, wondering what had detained
me.
</p>

<p>
"There is still time to take the drive," I said, in
reply to their eager questions. "I saw a number of
carriages coming down by the Square of the Martyrs.
Get in, Zelphine, and I will explain my delay as we
drive along."
</p>

<p>
All Naples seemed to be <i>en voiture</i>, this afternoon,
and it was pleasant to be making a <i>course</i> with the
languid, dark-eyed ladies and their attendant cavaliers,
even if we were not intimately associated with
them.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
March 7th.
</p>

<p>
This whole morning we spent in the Aquarium,
which is down near the sea, a part of the Villa Nazionale.
Here we saw all manner of beautiful and
hideous creatures of the deep, some exquisitely colored
fish from the Mediterranean, living coral, medusæ,
crested blubbers, airy and transparent as soap-bubbles,
and the wonderful octopus. Angela insisted on seeing
these horrible creatures fed, and by the time that
important ceremony was over and we had walked
through the shaded park enjoying the flowers, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51'>51</a></span>
are blooming in profusion everywhere, it was time to
go home for our second breakfast.
</p>

<p>
We went to Posilipo in the steam tram, this afternoon,
and were shown the old Roman columbarium on
the hillside, popularly known as the Tomb of Virgil.
Whether or not the poet was buried there is now disputed
by scholars; however, Zelphine says that Virgil
certainly wrote his "Georgics" and "Æneid" in his
villa near by, and that Petrarch considered this tomb
sufficiently important to plant a laurel here. She and I
have no patience with the iconoclasts who take so much
pleasure in destroying our illusions, and we see no
reason why the traveller should not be allowed to weep
over this tomb of Virgil, unless, indeed, a more authentic
one can be furnished him.
</p>

<p>
Later we climbed up to the terraced garden that
belongs to the Ristorante Promessi Sposi&mdash;fancy an
inn at home named The Betrothed! Here we had
afternoon tea, while our eyes were feasted with the
beauties of a gorgeous sunset. Vesuvius, Capri, Ischia,
and all the smaller islands of the bay were bathed in
heliotrope light, a royal array of purple velvet.
Buchanan Read's lines on the Bay of Naples must have
been inspired by just such a sea and sky as this. Zelphine
evidently had the same thought, for she quoted
softly:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52'>52</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

I am finishing this letter rather hurriedly for to-night's

AN EXCITING DRIVE

<hr class="l30" />

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Cava dei Tirreni</span>, March 8th.
</p>

<p>
We have spent the day in the streets and houses
of Pompeii, living over again in the buried city the
thrilling scenes of Lord Lytton's novel. His descriptions
are still marvellously accurate, although so
much has been unearthed since he wrote "The Last
Days of Pompeii" that the ruins as they stand to-day
are much more extensive than those pictured by the
novelist. The house of Glaucus is called by the guides
the House of the Tragic Poet, but the mosaic of the
dog, with its inscription, "Cave canem," apparently
as perfect as in the days when Glaucus thus whimsically
greeted his friends and enemies, serves to
identify it.
</p>

<p>
Lord Lytton was in Naples during the winter of
the most important excavations at Pompeii, and his
romance doubtless took form and shape as he walked
through these deserted streets, where the ruts made by
the chariot-wheels of the two rivals, Glaucus and
Arbaces, are still to be seen. The houses, as he tells
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54'>54</a></span>
us, still undespoiled of their exquisite decorations and
rich furniture, were much as their unfortunate owners
left them. Even now, despite the fact that many of
the beautiful frescoes, statues, busts, and other ornaments
have been taken to the Naples Museum, much
is still left of the interior of the houses, enough to
give one a very good idea of how these luxurious
Pompeians lived. The lower floors of some of these
houses, as that of the Vettii and the Faun, are complete,
with their vestibule, dining-room, parlor, bedrooms,
and kitchen. These rooms are all rather small,
according to our ideas, as the wise Pompeians lived
out of doors, spending their days in the large central
court of their houses or in the gardens. Of the gardens
we saw the most perfect examples in the house
of the Vettii. The restoration seems to have been made
most carefully here as elsewhere; even the graceful
bronze statuettes are not wanting, as excellent replicas
have been put in the places of the originals, which are
in the Naples Museum.
</p>

<p>
Nothing brings the reality of that old life before us
more forcibly than to walk along the streets, where
the bakeries and the wine and oil shops are still to be
found. In the latter are many great jars, which are, as
Zelphine says, not unlike those in which Morgiana
entrapped her Forty Thieves.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55'>55</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Turning a corner, we were startled by seeing a
roughly drawn sketch upon a wall, such as any street
gamin of to-day might draw upon a tempting blank
surface. Further along the same street we beheld a
still stronger evidence that the life of Pompeii was
not altogether different from that of our own time.
Something corresponding to a modern poster announced
in red letters the name of a favorite candidate
for the next municipal election. We lingered long in
the vast amphitheatre, in which the Pompeians were
wont to take their pleasure, protected in sunny weather
by an awning, whose usefulness we could appreciate
to-day, as the sun of March is intensely hot in this
region. The barracks for the gladiators, near the
theatre, are not unlike the casemates for soldiers in
a fort, and are quite complete. Zelphine, who is
sitting near me, poring over Bulwer's novel, has just
read me Pansa's lament over what he considered an
infamous law, that forbade a man to send his own
slaves to the wild beasts in the arena. Having seen
the houses of Glaucus and Pansa, one can more readily
understand the point of view of these luxurious,
pleasure-loving ancients, who were probably not more
cruel than many of their contemporaries.
</p>

<p>
We left Pompeii late this afternoon and came to
La Cava, a pretty town in the mountains, where we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56'>56</a></span>
are stopping on our way to Pæstum. Zelphine has just
been talking to the <i>padrone</i>, who speaks excellent English,
about the excursion to-morrow. Our tickets,
which we bought of the concierge at the Hotel B.,
entitle us to a drive or a railway journey. The
<i>padrone</i> strongly advises the former. He says the
trains are so slow and the waits so long that we make
almost as good time by driving, and then it is much
more interesting. The drive is between forty and
fifty miles, but by starting at eight o'clock in the
morning, and changing horses at Battipaglia, we shall
have two hours at Pæstum and get back to this hotel
in time for dinner. Another party of American
travellers, of the inconvenient number of five, go by
coach to-morrow. The <i>padrone</i> asks us, in case we
decide to drive, whether we will give a seat in our
carriage to the odd number. Having concluded to
drive, we are hoping that the fifth wheel of the other
coaching-party may prove to be Mrs. Coxe, a charming
old lady who talks most picturesquely of a drive to
Pæstum forty years ago, when the roads were so infested
by brigands that it was necessary to travel with
a mounted escort.
</p>

<p>
"Could anything be more delightfully romantic?"
exclaims Zelphine, on hearing this.
</p>

<p>
"Or more horridly uncomfortable?" adds Angela.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57'>57</a></span>
</p>

<p>
These exclamations drew from Mrs. Coxe a detailed
and spirited recital of her adventures, which Zelphine
heard with the great wide-open eyes of a child listening
to a fairy-tale. Women of Mrs. Coxe's age delight
in a sympathetic listener. The members of her own
party have doubtless heard all of her <i>contes de voyage</i>.
She will certainly elect to go with us, and have the
advantage of a new and appreciative audience.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
March 9th.
</p>

<p>
I opened my windows this morning and stepped out
on the marble terrace to enjoy a view of the mountains,
which had looked so enchanting by moonlight and were
no less beautiful by day. In the garden below a blue
gown flitting about among the orange-trees attracted
my attention. Angela had evidently brought her
charms to bear upon the heart of the <i>padrone</i>, as I
heard him say, "Here are scissors for the signorina
to cut all the oranges she wishes. In the signorina's
own country the oranges do not grow up to the doorstep
as with us. Is it not so?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed," said Angela, deftly snipping off a
golden ball. "This is a great pleasure. I never cut
an orange from a tree but once in my life, and that
was in Granada."
</p>

<p>
Being possessed of an inquiring turn of mind, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58'>58</a></span>
<i>padrone</i> asked many questions concerning Granada,
and so talking and working industriously Angela soon
collected a fine dish of oranges for our breakfast&mdash;an
unwonted luxury, as in this land of abundance they
never give us fruit for our early <i>déjeuner</i>. The carriages
were at the door before we had finished our
breakfast, and in ours, as though in answer to our
desires, sat Mrs. Coxe, provided with a guide-book,
lorgnette, lunch, and all the equipment of a good
traveller for a long day's drive.
</p>

<p>
The proprietor announced that he would accompany
us as far as Salerno, occupying the seat on the box
beside the driver and his little brother. Mrs. Coxe
evidently considered this her opportunity for informing
herself with regard to the country, its inhabitants,
and its productions. She had added not a little to
her already large store of information, gained in many
lands, when the <i>padrone</i>, to our great regret, left us,
with many bows, smiles, and wishes for a "bel giro."
</p>

<p>
We had the very tip-top of the morning for the
beginning of our drive, as we set forth at eight o'clock.
The air is soft and clear like that of a May day at
home. We can scarcely believe that it is March, and
that our friends across the water are still in the grasp
of winter, as we left all that behind us when we sailed
from New York six weeks ago.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i058fp" id="i058fp"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class='smcap'>On the Road to Paestum</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59'>59</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Our way lay between green meadows dotted with
purple cyclamen and a small yellow flower much like
the English primrose, and in some places through
groves of orange-trees covered with golden fruit.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for those who take this long drive, the
roads are excellent. We drove slowly through the old
town of Cava, with its narrow, precipitous streets, and
through Salerno, which is upon a bluff overlooking the
bay, and commands a noble panorama of sea and
shore. When, however, we reached the plain, our
horses set forth at a brisk pace. There was not much
to be seen here except acres of fennel, artichoke, and
a bean, now covered with white blossoms, which I
believe is used chiefly for feeding the cattle. Even
this road through a flat country is not without a touch
of picturesqueness, as it is in many places bordered
by gnarled sycamores twisted into the most weird and
grotesque shapes. Between these trees a peasant
woman was walking, bearing upon her head an immense
brush-heap, which was probably her winter
firewood. Zelphine and Angela had their kodaks with
them, of course, and begged the driver to stop and
allow them to get a snap-shot, which he did, crying out,
"Ecco, ecco, signora!" The woman stopped obediently,
and stood like a statue, in a natural pose full
of grace and strength. She was evidently pleased to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60'>60</a></span>
have her picture taken, as these peasants always are,
especially if a few soldi are thrown in to seal the contract.
If the picture is good you shall have one, as
it will give you a characteristic bit of this Southern
Italian life.
</p>

<p>
Here women young and old are to be seen working
in the fields with the men, driving ox-carts, walking
beside them, and bearing burdens that seem far too
heavy for any woman's shoulders. Although the land
seems fertile, the people are evidently very poor, the
villages small, and the houses comfortless.
</p>

<p>
We should have liked to ask the driver some questions
about the products of the soil, the peasants, and
their lives, but neither he nor his little brother, who
was on the box beside him, adapted themselves gracefully
to the restrictions of our vocabulary&mdash;there is,
we find, a great difference in drivers in this respect.
At Battipaglia, a railroad station and the most considerable
town on the route, we changed horses and
drivers also. This latter substitution we found was to
our advantage, as the second <i>vetturino</i> proved to be
a better linguist than his predecessor, which enabled us
to continue our interrupted studies in agriculture and
political economy. The new driver was serviceable
also in other respects. When we came upon a field of
narcissus, he stopped the carriage in order to allow us
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61'>61</a></span>
the pleasure of gathering the fragrant blossoms, besides
bringing us handfuls of flowers, the largest
bunch of course being laid at Angela's feet. We are
quite sure that he considers her the living image of the
pictures of the Blessed Virgin, although he is too discreet
to say so.
</p>

<p>
Angela was charming to-day, in a blue suit and a
white shirt-waist, but the March sun was so hot that
by the time we reached Pæstum it had taken all the
color out of the crown of her pretty blue hat.
</p>

<p>
As there is no inn at Pæstum we ate our luncheon
by the roadside, stopping under the shade of a tree
where a peasant was enjoying his siesta, his oxen
being tethered near by. Zelphine is enthusiastic over
the beauty of these gentle creatures, with their soft,
kindly brown eyes, and says that she is sure that
Homer, when he wrote of his ox-eyed maidens, had
just such a one in mind as she was feeding from her
hand. She made so pretty a picture as she stood
beside the great white ox, feeding him daintily with
bean-blossoms, that Angela tried to get a snap-shot
of her, but that provoking ox&mdash;the slowest of all
animals&mdash;took it into his head to move at the critical
moment.
</p>

<p>
The country seemed more level and marshy as we
drew near Pæstum, although on the left there rose the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62'>62</a></span>
spur of a mountain range, on one of whose heights are
the ruins of the hillside fortress of Capaccio Vecchio.
This town was founded by the inhabitants of Pæstum
when they were driven from their city by the Saracens
in the ninth century.
</p>

<p>
To our surprise, we saw herds of buffalo grazing in
the fields, much smaller and different in other respects
from the American bison. Our driver told us
that this small black buffalo is to be found near the
coast in many parts of Italy, and is often seen on the
Campagna near Rome. From the number of calves
in some of the fields we are inclined to think that the
young buffaloes are used for food. I noticed several
of the well-grown animals drawing carts, sometimes
harnessed with the white oxen.
</p>

<p>
We caught a glimpse of the old wall and gate with
the sea beyond, and then in a moment the temples
were in full view. Nothing could be more impressive
than those magnificent ruins on that lonely plain,
sharply outlined against the blue sky. The Temple
of Neptune, with its thirty-six fluted Doric columns,
its double columns inside, and its noble, almost perfect
façade, is a superb example of Greek architecture
of the fifth century B.C. The stone of which the
temple is built is a kind of travertine, to which the
passing years have imparted a creamy, mellow tone.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63'>63</a></span>
The Temple of Ceres is less complete than that
dedicated to Neptune, although it belongs to the same
period. The gate of the town opening out toward the
sea and the old wall adjoining it are wonderfully
preserved. These with the temples of Neptune and
Ceres and the so-called Basilica are all that remain of
this settlement made by Greeks from Sybaris about
600 B.C. Two days we have passed with the ancients,
yesterday in a city where "the earth, with faithful
watch, has hoarded all," and to-day in a town not
much older than Pompeii, where the conquering Saracens
and Normans and the devastating elements have
left nothing to tell the tale of the daily life and habits
of the Greeks who made their home upon these shores.
</p>

<p>
We climbed over the ruins of the old temples and sat
upon the town wall overlooking the sea, while Angela
made a fairly good sketch of the temples. Zelphine
and I bought coins and pottery from children who,
being without visible habitation, seemed to have literally
sprung from the soil. Finally our <i>vetturino</i>
warned us that we had better set forth at once if we
wished to reach Cava before nightfall.
</p>

<p>
At Battipaglia we resumed our former horses and
driver. Zelphine whispered something to me about
his face being rather red. I quite agreed with her,
but as the mention of the fact could not be of any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64'>64</a></span>
especial advantage, the other carriage being already
far in advance and no person at hand to take the
reins, there was nothing to do but to set forth on our
homeward journey, despite some misgivings upon
Zelphine's part and mine.
</p>

<p>
We had not left Battipaglia before I realized that
our gravest fears were fulfilled. Our driver was what
you men picturesquely call "gloriously drunk"&mdash;we
practical women would use a less dignified adverb.
He was as happy as a lord, cracking his whip and
dashing through the streets of Battipaglia in fine
style. We soon passed the other coach, containing
Mrs. Coxe's friends. They called after us, but must
have seen that we had no time for conversation
<i>en route</i>; indeed, like Cowper's citizen "of credit
and renown," we passed everything on the road. Zelphine
and I were on the front seat, facing Mrs. Coxe
and Angela. They, happily, did not grasp the situation
at once, but when they did the terror written on
that dear old lady's face was something never to be
forgotten. Angela, with resolute cheerfulness, chatted
away about anything and everything, especially about
Mrs. Coxe's experiences in Honolulu, her favorite subject
of conversation. I shall never hear of that island
kingdom of the Pacific without seeing before me
Mrs. Coxe's agonized face.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65'>65</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Remembering that there lay before us a long
stretch of road overhanging a sharp declivity, Zelphine
and I made a desperate attempt to stop our
hilarious <i>vetturino</i> in his mad career. Finding that
our remonstrances excited him to more strenuous
exertions, Zelphine tried the effect of her few available
words and many eloquent gestures upon the small
boy, urging him to make his brother drive more carefully,
telling him that the old lady of the party was
very much alarmed, and advising him to get the whip
into his own hands. This, however, proved to be impossible;
the boy, well frightened himself by this time,
only succeeded in getting hard words and a shaking.
Give up his whip! Not he. As well ask a soldier to
lay down his arms. The whip was his pride and joy,
his <i>pièce de résistance</i>, so to speak, with which he
awoke the echoes of these slumbering old Italian
towns, bringing the inhabitants, men, women, children,
cats, dogs, and chickens, to the sidewalk to witness our
rapid transit. Even those among our own countrymen
who pride themselves most upon their skill in
annihilating space could not have made better time
than we did as we rattled over that Calabrian highway.
Fortunately, the horses were well-trained and
steady enough to balance the driver's eccentricities.
Perhaps they were accustomed to them by long experience.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66'>66</a></span>
Be this as it may, we proceeded on our way
without any accident, passing the dangerous part of
the road before darkness overtook us.
</p>

<p>
We clattered through Salerno at a tearing gallop,
and as we neared La Cava the whip-cracking was
resumed with renewed vigor, bringing the citizens
to their doors and windows. Some of them, indeed,
followed the carriage, crying out, "Prima donna!
Prima donna!"
</p>

<p>
"What can they mean?" asked Mrs. Coxe, looking
as though she expected to be attacked by a furious
mob. Zelphine reminded her that as we drove by the
theatre in the morning we had noticed a poster announcing
that a grand opera was to be given in Cava
that evening. In our gay morning spirits we had
even thought that it might be pleasant to assist at the
function. Now the most that we dared to hope was
that we might reach the hotel in safety. Troops of
children ran after us, repeating the shout of "Prima
donna! Prima donna!"
</p>

<p>
"We are honored by being mistaken for a part of
the opera troupe," said Zelphine, laughing, "and
Angela is evidently the leading lady, as they are all
looking at her."
</p>

<p>
Angela, sitting erect on the back seat, her costume
as crisp and immaculate as if she were on her way to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67'>67</a></span>
a horse-show, her jaunty hat at the most stylish angle
even if the crown was off color, looked indeed like a
leading lady, albeit a trifle pale and in need of the aid
of the rouge-pot of the greenroom.
</p>

<p>
When we reached our hotel we were all exhausted
by the fatigue of the day and the long strain of the
afternoon; but Mrs. Coxe showed herself the thorough-going
traveller that she is by stopping not for
rest or refreshment until she had laid a detailed
account of our experiences before the proprietor.
</p>

<p>
He came to us later, after a visit to the driver's
home, and reported him as covered with confusion and
filled with remorse. "<i>Ecco, ecco</i>, he is the penitent
one now!" exclaimed the <i>padrone</i>. "His parents
have scolded him soundly, and have threatened to
beat him with a stick. He is in tears, the sorrowful
one! It is the first time, and it will never happen
again!"
</p>

<p>
"All of which would not mend our bones if they
had been broken!" said Mrs. Coxe, stoutly. "It is
your duty to give your patrons good, safe drivers."
</p>

<p>
The <i>padrone</i> then called upon the saints to witness
to the fact that he had never known an accident to
befall any of his patrons, repeating that this was
Antonio's first offence, and that he must have been
drinking some bad stuff at the tavern, as good wine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68'>68</a></span>
would never so set the brain on fire. The proprietor
has a frank manner that gives one the impression that
he is speaking the truth; we are inclined to believe
him, although we have been warned not to allow ourselves
to be deceived by appearances in this land of
ready eloquence. Our valiant countrywoman having
made her protest for the party, and this disagreeable
duty having been taken off our shoulders, we went
into dinner with high spirits and famous appetites.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine and I are so wide awake after our exciting
drive that we are devoting the evening to letter-writing,
both of us being sadly in arrears. The other
guests of the Hotel S. have betaken themselves to
their slumbers, and we enjoy undisturbed possession
of the only warm room in the house. A wood fire blazes
on the hearth, and as we bask in its genial warmth we
shiver at the thought of our rooms upstairs, which,
with their stone floors, are of about the temperature
of refrigerators.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Sorrento</span>, March 11th.
</p>

<p>
We left Cava on Wednesday, and made the tour
from there to Amalfi in the brilliant morning sunshine.
This is another "Cornice Drive," and far
finer, I think, than that along the Riviera. The road
winds above, beneath, and beside rugged cliffs of
great height, always with the sea in full view. Often
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69'>69</a></span>
from airy summits we looked down upon fishing
villages and towns built around bays and inlets,
as Cetara and Atrani, while upon projecting headlands
are many watch-towers, now used chiefly as
dwellings.
</p>

<p>
We needed not to be told that the making of macaroni
is one of the chief industries of Amalfi. As we
drew near the town many yards of it were to be seen
hanging upon lines like a wash or spread upon the
grass to dry.
</p>

<p>
Amalfi is charmingly situated at the entrance to a
deep ravine, surrounded by mountains and rocks
of the most picturesque forms. We climbed up the
sixty steps of the Cathedral of St. Andrew. Mrs.
Coxe and some of her party were carried up in chairs
by two stout Calabrians, but we preferred to walk,
turning every now and then to gaze upon the enchanting
view spread before us. At the top of the slope is
a spacious garden terrace full of flowers, with roses
climbing all over its walls.
</p>

<p>
We stopped overnight at the old Capuchin monastery,
which is now fitted up as a hotel, and yesterday
drove here, the greater part of the way beside terraces
of lemon-trees covered with ripening fruit&mdash;enough
lemons to make lemonade for the whole world,
one would think. As we drew near Sorrento orange-trees
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70'>70</a></span>
took the place of lemon-trees, groves and groves
of them, with their dark, shining leaves and brilliantly
colored fruit. Peasants brought oranges to the carriage
for sale, clusters of them, with fruit and blossoms
growing together, which they were glad to give
us for a few soldi.
</p>

<p>
This morning we spent in the shops buying wood-carvings
and silk, which is made here, and is consequently
astonishingly cheap. We found Mr. Crawford's
charming villa, and, to Zelphine's great delight,
the house of Tasso's sister on the Strada San Nicola.
Tasso's birthplace and the rock upon which the house
stood have both been swallowed up by the sea; but the
house of his sister Cornelia, to which the great Tasso
came in 1592 disguised as a shepherd, is still standing,
and there is a statue of Torquato Tasso in the
chief square of Sorrento.
</p>

<p class="caption"><span class='smcap'>An Amazonian Tribute, Capri</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
I am writing on a fine terrace overlooking the sea,
where stone benches and tables are conveniently
arranged for our use. The sun is like that of June,
and roses such as belong to that month are blooming
all over the wall beside me. The concierge has just
brought me a handful of them, charming pink and
white ones. We are equipped for a drive to the
Deserto, which Mrs. Coxe, who visited the place forty
years ago, tells us is most interesting. Within a few
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71'>71</a></span>
years the monastery has been suppressed, and the
building is now used as a home for destitute children.
</p>

<p>
We should like to spend a week in Sorrento, which
is so beautiful itself and from which so many excursions
are to be made; but Capri beckons to us from
across the bay and our time is limited, as Zelphine has
promised to meet some cousins in Naples.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Capri</span>, March 13th.
</p>

<p>
Our reception on the island of the Blue Grotto was
sufficiently novel to please the most blasé traveller.
As our boat drew near the rocky shore dozens of
women, most of them young and handsome, hurried
down to the wharf and seized our luggage, which they
bore on their heads easily and lightly up the steep
path to the hotel. It seemed strange enough to have
women carry our dress-suit-cases and bags, but on our
way to the hotel we saw a much more unusual sight&mdash;three
women carrying two trunks and a valise, while
a man, evidently the owner of the trunks, was walking
quite at his ease beside them. He was, we were
told later, a Caprian peasant on his way to America,
and this delicate attention was a final act of devotion
on the part of his Amazonian countrywomen.
</p>

<p>
Capri has not been as kind to us as other towns of
Southern Italy. The mountains have had their heads
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72'>72</a></span>
buried in clouds all the morning, and when the
donkeys arrived which we had ordered for a ride up to
the Villa of Tiberius, a fine rain was falling, which
prevented us from making the excursion. We sent
the donkeys and their women drivers home, much to
the disappointment of the latter.
</p>

<p>
"Women seem to do everything here!" said Angela.
"Where are the men?"
</p>

<p>
"Gone to America," replied Mrs. Coxe, quickly.
"The women ship them off, bag and baggage, and
then have everything their own way."
</p>

<p>
Fortune favored us later in the day, as the clouds
rolled off the mountains before noon, and the <i>padrone</i>
informed us that the wind was in the right quarter
for a visit to the Blue Grotto. We made our expedition
satisfactorily, although the sea was high and we
literally rode the waves in our small boats. The
grotto is quite as blue as any picture of it that I have
ever seen, and with an exquisite, luminous transparency
that no brush or pencil can portray. When we
were in the midst of the silvery blueness, watching
with some apprehension a small boy who dives into the
water to show off its wonderful color, our boatman
suddenly became loquacious, and told us thrilling tales
of unfortunate visitors to the grotto who had been
walled in by the sea and were obliged to spend days
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73'>73</a></span>
and even weeks in this drear abode, living upon supplies
which daring sailors, who contrived to get their
boats near to the mouth of the grotto, handed in to
them. The smallness of the opening of the grotto gave
a semblance of reality to these Münchausen tales.
Mrs. Coxe, who was in the boat with me, became
very much alarmed and insisted upon leaving
at once, calling to the other members of the party
to follow. We were splashed a little by the spray
as we emerged from the grotto, and those in the
other boats were quite wet; but as we rowed away
the mouth of the fairy cave was almost hidden by the
waves. It seemed indeed as if there might be a grain
of truth in the boatman's tales, which the <i>padrone</i>
corroborated, adding, "But it does not often happen
that travellers are shut up for any time in the Grotta
Azzurra; we are very careful." "Not very often
indeed! As if once would not be enough!" exclaimed
Mrs. Coxe, who had interrogated the <i>padrone</i> after her
straightforward fashion of getting at the truth of the
matter.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Hotel B., Naples</span>, March 15th.
</p>

<p>
We are glad to be in Naples again, and in this homelike
hotel. Zelphine has met her cousins, and has been
making some excursions with them, taking the famous
drive to the monastery of Camaldoli and to the Solfatara,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74'>74</a></span>
a half-extinct volcano which, she says, gives
one an even more impressive idea of the Inferno than
the Doré illustrations of Dante. Angela corroborated
Zelphine's report, saying that it was quite the most
unpleasant place she had ever seen, especially as they
dropped a poor dog into the crater to try the effects
of the sulphur upon his constitution. They pulled
him out before he was quite dead; but who except
these cruel Neapolitans would so persecute a helpless
animal?
</p>

<p>
I, with my old habit of clinging to the skirts of the
things I already know, declined to take that excursion,
for the greater pleasure of spending a morning
in the National Museum among the Pompeian treasures
and another whole day among the ruins of the
buried city. It is really much more interesting to
examine the relics from Pompeii after one has been
there, as one naturally fits the frescoes, furniture, and
ornaments into just such rooms as one has seen. Some
of the furniture was strangely modern; I noticed a red
and gilt bedstead that looked as if it might have belonged
to the First French Empire, rather than to the
first century A.D. Among the kitchen furnishings were
just such colanders, saucepans, and skillets as we use
to-day&mdash;is there anything really new under this shining
sun? The surgical and dental instruments exhibited
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75'>75</a></span>
in one of the cases caused me a genuine thrill of
sympathy for those unhappy Pompeians; to have been
smothered with hot ashes might really have been more
endurable than to have lived at the mercy of those
primitive dentists and surgeons!
</p>

<p>
We leave Naples to-morrow with regret, as we have
grown very fond of this beautiful city. I wrote a week
since to Ludovico Baldini, and also to the proprietor
of a hotel that he recommended to me; but I have
heard from neither. Ludovico may be in Florence on
some army business, but it is very stupid of the proprietor
of the Hotel L. not to answer my letter. We
have telegraphed for rooms in a pension on the Via
Sistina, which Mrs. Coxe tells us is delightful, and
we are thankful to know that they will accommodate
us, as Rome is full to overflowing now, all the world
going up thither for Easter. When I told my maid
that we were going to Rome to-morrow, she clasped her
hands in ecstasy, exclaiming, "Bella Roma! Bella
Roma!" These Italians have a natural instinct for
beauty and a genuine pride in the wonders of their own
country, both of which help them to endure the
poverty and hardness of their lives, just as some
people of your acquaintance and mine are supported
through many trials by the uplifting sense of having
been born in the purple.

We felt as if we had accomplished a day's work before
we left Naples, this morning, the getting away
from these places is so laborious. After our trunks
were strapped and ready for the <i>facchini</i> and porters,
the feeing of the servants had to be attended to. This
was Angela's especial task. She had managed the
financial part of our six days' trip so admirably that
Zelphine and I have honored her by electing her bursar
for the party. She does not seem fully to appreciate
the honor we have conferred upon her, but with her
usual amiability she is quite willing to do the work.
</p>

<p>
When the servants all lined up in the dining-room,
they made a formidable array. I did not wonder that
Angela looked as if she would rather be somewhere
else. She was getting through the ordeal very creditably,
however, when the <i>padrone</i> appeared upon the
scene; very indelicate of him, was it not, to come in
just then? This so embarrassed Angela that she was
very near giving him the generous tip that she had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77'>77</a></span>
dedicated to the head waiter. Would he have taken it,
think you? Zelphine says that he certainly would, as
no hotel-keeper in Italy can withstand the glint of
silver. Be this as it may, we are glad that Angela
did not persist in her indiscriminate generosity, as our
purses are already seriously depleted by the demands
made upon them by chambermaids, <i>facchini</i>, head
porter, sub-porter, concierge, head waiter and his troop
of underlings, each one with an empty hand and an
expectant eye. There is, we have learned, a long step
between the <i>facchini</i> and the porter, and still another
social gradation between the porter and the concierge.
The latter is quite an important personage, in a fine
uniform, who usually speaks excellent English,
French, and often several other languages.
</p>

<p>
At the station we had to undergo the weighing of
our luggage, a weariness to the flesh at all times,
but especially trying to-day, as all the world seemed
to be <i>en route</i> for Rome. We were detained so long
that we barely had time to catch our train. I sometimes
wonder if any one ever actually lost one of these
slow-moving trains. We travelled second class to-day,
"for local color," as Zelphine says. In point of
comfort there seems to us little difference between
first and second class; the former have stuffy plush
coverings on the seats, instead of leather and reps, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78'>78</a></span>
somewhat more select company. Our companions
were two well-to-do young matrons, an old peasant
woman, and three children. The two younger women
were inclined to be sociable as far as our common
vocabularies permitted, and plied us with questions,
which we answered with more or less accuracy
according to our ability&mdash;it is sometimes difficult
to be entirely truthful in a language one does not
understand; but Zelphine did most of the talking,
having developed considerable facility in speaking
French with a fine Italian accent. Confusing as
this mongrel dialect might be to an educated Italian,
it often stands us in good stead with shopkeepers,
maids, cabbies, and <i>facchini</i>, and to-day seemed tolerably
intelligible to our <i>compagnons de voyage</i>.
Indeed, we became so intimate that one of the women
asked Zelphine for her vinaigrette for the "bambino"
to smell, the bambino having proved herself
to be a poor traveller.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine invariably carries a black satin bag, which
we have dubbed "Mrs. Lecks," because, like Frank
Stockton's queen of emergencies, it always provides
what we need at any given moment, whether it
happens to be a shoe-button or a guide-book. The
bambino was fascinated by the smelling-bottle, and
stretched out her hand for it as soon as Zelphine took
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79'>79</a></span>
it from the depths of Mrs. Lecks and applied it to her
own patrician nostrils. As this is a country where
bambinos seem to be denied nothing, the mother's
hand was also outstretched, and there was nothing
for Zelphine to do but to hand over her dainty
vinaigrette to that untidy-looking baby. Now was
not that a trial of good nature?
</p>

<p>
Angela was much interested in a half-starved, ill-clad
boy of ten or twelve, who was, the old peasant
informed us, an <i>orfano</i> adopted by her. We wondered
how these people came to be travelling second
class, as everything about them indicated extreme
poverty. The orphan's eyes gleamed when Angela
spread out her luncheon, and she made haste to share
her rolls and figs with him, while we offered our
refreshments to the other occupants of the carriage,
having understood that this is Italian etiquette. They,
with many compliments, declined the bounty&mdash;which
may also be in accordance with good breeding in Italy&mdash;all
except the orphan, who fell upon Angela's
stores with the appetite of youth sharpened by a
long fast from dainties. Upon this the old woman,
not to be outdone, drew forth from a stuff bag a
loaf of brown bread wrapped in a red kerchief such
as she wore on her head, and proceeded to cut off
a goodly slice. Angela begged her for a small piece,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80'>80</a></span>
<i>piccolo</i> being one of the words that she knows, and
I came to the rescue by handing her a bottle of wine
and begging her to give the old dame a generous
glass of it. This libation proved so acceptable that I
really do not think that the woman knew whether or
not Angela had eaten that untempting bit of bread.
She finally hid it under her napkin, saying, "A bit of
local color, Zelphine, that I will share with you later."
</p>

<p>
We found little to interest us in this journey of
more than five hours over a level, sparsely wooded
country, whose monotony was broken now and again
by an abrupt rise in the ground. These hills that have
been thrown up from the general flatness of the land
by some internal disturbance are generally crowned
by a church and monastery, and many of them by
towns of some size. As they rise from the plain, gray
buildings upon gray rocks, standing out against the
blue of the sky, they perfectly fulfil one's idea of a
fortress town of the middle ages.
</p>

<p>
The guide-books are all written for those who reach
Rome from the north, but however the Eternal City
may appear from other approaches, we felt that we
were fortunate in our first view of her spires and
domes across the green and blossoming Campagna.
Through a mist or delicate veil of peach and almond
blossoms we saw her seated upon her seven hills, glorious,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81'>81</a></span>
dominant, the mother of us all, drawing us to her
by the power of her great past and the charm of her
beautiful present. You probably remember that when
Mrs. Browning visited Rome as early as 1854, she found
it to be disappointingly modern, "a palimpsest Rome&mdash;a
watering-place written over the antique." Zelphine
and I had heard somewhat the same criticism from so
many intelligent and conscientious travellers that we
were prepared for disappointment. I can truthfully
say that despite the overlying modern characters the
ancient writing on the walls reveals itself so plainly
that, even with all this weight of authority against us,
we are not disappointed. Mrs. Browning's impressions
of Rome were clouded, as she herself confesses, by the
sad death of Mr. Story's little boy, Penini's playmate,
which occurred soon after her arrival, and by
her consequent anxiety about her own child. Then,
again, vast tracts of ancient Rome have been unearthed
since Mrs. Browning looked upon the Forum,
which was then level with the street, and overgrown
with vines and gay with flowers.
</p>

<p>
Of course, railroad stations cannot fail to be modern,
customs officials are unpleasantly up-to-date in
their ways, and it seems strangely incongruous to
find electric trams whirling around St. Peter's, the
Coliseum, and the Forum; but having once accepted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82'>82</a></span>
these innovations, we were pleased to find antiquity
raising its hoary head at every turn. Near the bustling
railroad station are the great ruins of the Baths
of Diocletian, and driving from thence to the Via
Sistina we passed through a most interesting street
named after the four fountains that adorn it. The
Via Sistina, where we are lodged, joins the Via
Gregoriana a few steps from our pension, and at the
angle of meeting is a quaint, picturesque house where
the Zuccari, a family of artists, once lived. A little
further on is the ancient Church of Trinità de' Monti,
where one may hear the nuns sing their vesper hymns
on Sunday afternoons, and beyond the church the wide
pergola of ilex-trees, twisted and bent and clipped
in a fashion known only to Italian gardeners. This
broad pergola shades the sunny street leading to the
Pincio, or "Hill of Gardens," as the ancients called
it. Here we found our way soon after our arrival,
and sitting upon the stone wall above the
Piazza del Popolo we basked in the warm sunshine
and read our home letters, with Rome spread before
us. St. Peter's, with the long line of the Vatican
buildings, a city in themselves, lies to the right, and
quite near on the Tiber is the Castle of St. Angelo,
Hadrian's tomb, with an angel on the summit sheathing
his bloody sword, while on the western horizon, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83'>83</a></span>
far as the eye can reach, is the Janiculum Hill. We
could faintly trace upon its crest the outline of the
equestrian statue of Garibaldi, which dominates all
Rome, as indeed it should. We strolled back through
the blooming shrubbery and the pergola to the Square
of Trinità de' Monti, and down those Spanish Steps
of which we have read so much&mdash;great, wide steps,
so many of them that we have not the courage to count
them, and of marble that is neither white nor gray but
of a warm yellow tone with a dash of pink in it,
reminding us of the soft shades of the gates of the
Alhambra. To the left as one goes down the steps
is a square yellow house, where John Keats passed
the last suffering weeks of his life. This house was
selected for Keats by Dr. Clark because it was near
his own. A square tablet marks the building as the
one from which this rare spirit "outsoared the
shadow of our night."
</p>

<p>
At the foot of the Spanish Steps are the vendors
of flowers. Men and women are always to be found
here selling the most exquisite roses, lilies, daffodils,
frisias, anemones, giant mignonette of the most fragrant
kind, and long sprays of peach and almond blossoms.
Fancy, if you can, the steps, above them the
Piazza of Santa Trinità de' Monti, with its marble
balustrades, and the Piazza di Spagna below, with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84'>84</a></span>
its sparkling fountain, all bathed in the most brilliant
sunshine, and you will believe that we are indeed well
placed, living near so much that is beautiful.

<p>
Although there were a thousand things to be seen
in Rome, we turned our backs upon them all and
went to Tivoli yesterday, because a pleasant party
was going from here and the day was fine. We drove
through the newly built Veneto quarter, passing Queen
Margherita's palace, with its handsome broad façade,
which is directly on the street. The great gardens are
behind, surrounded by high walls overtopped by tall
camellia-trees full of their red and white blossoms.
We passed through the Porta San Lorenzo, beyond
which is the station for Tivoli. The road passes near
the Church of San Lorenzo, which is said to be a perfect
example of the basilica, as it rises in "its gray
reverend dignity" against the background of the
Campagna and the blue mountains of Tivoli. Inside
of this church are the tombs of Pius IX. and several
other popes, and frescoes and mosaics, ancient and
modern, of great richness.
</p>

<p>
Our road lay through a desolate-looking country,
but for that reason none the less dear to the heart of
the antiquarian. For near the river Anio and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85'>85</a></span>
Tuzia, both of which we crossed, our guide told us
that Hannibal had encamped; a little way beyond was
the hallowed grove of the Muses; and to the ruined
baths of the Aquæ Albulæ the captive queen of Palmyra
came from her villa near by, to bathe in the
milk-white water. The steam tram stopped for us
most accommodatingly at the sulphur springs, and
allowed us time to walk around and see all that is left
of this ancient resort. Here the emperors and tribunes
of Rome came to wash away their sins, just as our
politicians go to Saratoga and the Southern springs
for the same purpose. The water, which is always
spoken of as milk-white, seemed to us to have a decidedly
blue shade, an exquisite light blue. The
deposit left by the sulphur or sulphuretted hydrogen
has hardened in the beds of the streams and pools
into the most curious and grotesque shapes. These
deposits we afterwards found used at the Villa d'Este
and elsewhere for the decorations of the fountains.
</p>

<p>
At Tivoli hacks were awaiting us, in which we drove
to the Villa d'Este. This stately and imposing palace,
with its spacious garden, was worthy to be the residence
of one of the oldest and most distinguished
princely houses of Italy. We entered the palace enclosure
through the cloister of the Church of St.
Francis, and saw in the long corridors and spacious
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86'>86</a></span>
apartments many beautiful frescoes by Zuccaro and
Muziano. Some of these are considerably damaged by
the dampness, but many still exhibit rare grace of
design and richness of color. Beneath the villa is a
broad terrace ending in a noble archway, through
which one may look forth upon hillsides glorified by
the blossoming almond, peach and Judas trees. From
this terrace winding stairways lead to other terraces
below, upon each one of which fountains send up jets
of feathery spray that display their iridescent colors
against the background of huge cypresses. It is all
a dream of loveliness, and full of the indescribable
atmosphere of old-world charm. We could imagine
the poet Tasso, who was attached to the court of one
of the Dukes of Ferrara, drawing inspiration from
these classic groves, in whose leafy quiet the nightingale
must surely sing. Here the beautiful young
daughters of the house played in the sunshine of
the too brief girlhood granted to old-time princesses.
</p>

<p>
We afterwards drove through the old town, and
from a lower road had a good view of the temples and
churches, and of the heights of Monte Catillo, its
picturesque hillsides, and the cascades which seemed
to bubble forth from every fissure and crevice in the
rocks&mdash;so many waterfalls that one could not count
them all.

</div>

<p>
The hotel where we stopped for luncheon is built
upon a shelving rock on whose garden terrace we
sat overlooking the valley. Above us, on another
projection, was the little Temple of Vesta, the Sibyl,
or what you will&mdash;it seems to make little difference
what one calls this exquisite circular temple, as antiquarians
do not agree about its name. It is, however,
so graceful in form and so rich in coloring that,
like the rose, it is equally lovely by whatever name
it is called, especially as we saw it to-day, draped with
clematis and ivy, crowning

<p class="i1">
"The green steep whence Anio leaps,
</p>
<p class="i1">
In floods of snow-white foam."
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
After luncheon we made our excursion to Hadrian's
Villa, or Villa Adriana, as they now call it, which is
the chief object of interest at Tivoli and is worthy of
something more than a superficial inspection. As
you doubtless know, it is not a villa, or even a palace,
like the Villa d'Este, but a military or university
town. Here are quarters for the soldiers, dining-rooms
for the officers and their men, temples, libraries,
hospitals, baths, theatres, race-courses, gardens, and
fountains. Most of the sculptures have been carried
away from the beautiful Golden Court and the Hall
of Philosophy, but exquisite bits of stone carving are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88'>88</a></span>
still to be seen in the courts and baths, and mosaic
pavements looking as bright and fresh as when trodden
by the feet of Hadrian in A.D. 138.
</p>

<p>
As we passed through room after room, with their
more or less fragmentary decorations, Angela reminded
us of the story of the Western girl who, on her way
to Tivoli, hoped that when she called at the villa the
Hadrians would not be at home, as she had not put
on her best hat. Zelphine and I thought that this
"innocent abroad" must have been surprised to find
that when the Hadrians left their villa they had
taken away most of their furniture and ornaments
with them. What queer specimens of our own countrymen
we do meet <i>en voyage</i>! The question that we
ask ourselves most frequently is, why did they come?
</p>

<p class="ralign">
March 21st.
</p>

<p>
I have been wondering why I have not heard from
Ludovico Baldini. We went to the bank on the Piazza
di Spagna this morning, and found my Naples letter
lying unopened. To-day I had decided to go to
French, Lemon &amp;Co., thinking I had made a mistake
about the bank, when as we were walking along the
Via Nazionale on our way to the Rospigliosi Palace,
I saw a young man on the other side of the way take
off his hat and wave it as he dashed across the street.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89'>89</a></span>
Of course it was Ludovico, just returned from
Florence, as bright and cordial as ever, but very indignant
over not having had my letter forwarded to
him.
</p>

<p>
I think you must have met young Mr. Baldini, of
whom I speak so unceremoniously as Ludovico, as he
was often at our common friends', the W.'s, last year.
I met him first at Jamestown, in the summer, and he
gave me so many valuable suggestions about Italian
travel that I feel greatly indebted to him. He is
young, not much over twenty-one, but in some respects
seems older, and, being American on one side, he
combines considerable practical ability with the Italian
charm of manner which we all realize, even if we are
not always happy in describing it.
</p>

<p>
We had intended to go somewhere this afternoon
with Mrs. Robins and Bertha Linn, and when Ludovico
suggested our driving out to the meet near the
Tomb of Cæcilia Metella, we concluded that this was
the thing of all others that we wished to do, more
especially as this was the last meet of the season. We
arrayed ourselves in our best, as all the smart people
go to the meets here. Ludovico secured the most presentable
hacks that he could find, and we set forth,
following a gay procession of carriages along the
street of tombs to a sporting scene; but for such incongruities
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90'>90</a></span>
as this, commend me to the sympathetic
Italian!
</p>

<p>
The meet was worth seeing&mdash;fine horses, good riding,
life, motion, and color. There were many handsome,
well-dressed women in the carriages and walking
about; all this gayety brought out in strong relief by
the sombre background of the old aqueduct and the
great circular tomb of the beloved wife of Crassus.
</p>

<p>
As the carriages were crowded together, we left ours,
and attempted to walk over the field, as many persons
were doing. The horses and dogs turned suddenly
in our direction, and Mrs. Robins, in trying to get out
of their way, slipped, fell, and would have been
trampled by one of the horses had not his rider been a
most expert horseman. Ludovico was in a rage such
as these hot-blooded Latins alone are capable of, and
was ready to call out the young horseman, who had
done all that man could do to prevent an accident,
dismounting at once and most courteously apologizing.
"It is entirely our fault for being on foot where
horses and dogs had the right of way," I said to the
<i>cavaliere</i>, who bowed with the gravity of a Don
Quixote, evidently quite agreeing with me. Ludovico,
somewhat appeased, asked me to allow him to present
the gentleman, who was an acquaintance of his, and
this ceremony being accomplished satisfactorily they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91'>91</a></span>
both handed us to our carriages in fine style. As
Mrs. Robins fortunately was not hurt, we were all
able to enjoy the spirited scene from our coign of
vantage. The dogs broke covert over on the Campagna,
and then the rush and scamper of the gay
cavalcade across the plain was most exciting, horsemen
and hounds in full cry.
</p>

<p>
As it was still early in the afternoon, we decided to
drive to the Janiculum Hill to see the fine equestrian
statue of Garibaldi and the magnificent view from
what seems here quite a height, because it rises
abruptly from the plain, but is really less than three
hundred feet. The air was perfectly clear, and we
could literally behold all Rome, old and new, spread
out before us. Between the hill and the Tiber lies that
large quarter known as Trastevere, where are some of
the most interesting churches, as Santa Maria and
Santa Cecilia. Here beautiful villas once stood, but
Trastevere is now almost exclusively inhabited by the
working classes. A fine and handsome race, differing
in dialect from the citizens of other quarters of Rome,
the Trasteverians seem to have some right to the distinction
which they claim of being the direct descendants
of the ancient Romans.
</p>

<p>
On our return from the Janiculum we stopped at
St. Peter's in Montorio, which is on one of the slopes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92'>92</a></span>
of the Janiculum. Although the crowning glory of
this church, Raphael's Transfiguration, has been taken
from the high altar and carried to the Vatican, a few
good pictures still remain. What we desired to see
the most, though, was the little temple in the court
said to mark the spot where the cross of St. Peter
stood. The chapel contains a statue of the saint, and
below, down some steps, is a grewsome place where
he is said to have been crucified in a manner so horrible
that I really cannot undertake to describe it to
you. The impression made upon one by this spot is
somewhat the less thrilling because several other
places are shown as the scene of the martyrdom of
this great apostle. The woman who opened the temple
for us scratched up some of the earth and gave it to
us with great solemnity. Angela's face was a study
as she received her portion. She is not, as you may
believe, much of a relic-hunter.

<span class='smcap'>Via Sistina, Rome</span>, March 22d.
</p>

<p>
Your letter in answer to mine written from San
Remo reached me to-day. It really seems a year since
I wrote you that letter, instead of one month. So
many impressions have come crowding one upon
another since then that I cannot quite recall what I
said of a personal nature. The meeting with Genevra
brought back the old familiar associations so vividly
that we sometimes forgot all that had happened since
we had parted, and lived over our early, happy days.
If you read into my letter more than was meant, it is
because some of the glamour of that time caused
will-o'-the-wisps to mislead you. No, "gang your
ain gait, Allan," as your mother's old Scotch maid
used to say. You have a great future before you
in your profession, and I&mdash;it seems to me sometimes
that I have only a past, and a present which I live day
by day, with no plans for the years to come. It is
so difficult to readjust one's life to new standards, and
those who stake much lose heavily. We both loved
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94'>94</a></span>
Headley too well to say one harsh word about him. I
could not talk to you thus freely were it not so; indeed,
I never could <i>speak</i> to you at all about Headley&mdash;writing
is easier, across the great expanse of waters.
Now that I have broken the silence, let me say to you,
best of friends, that I have in this sunny land and
among these changing scenes found content, which
may in time reach the measure of happiness. Do not
disturb this peace, I beg of you, but be satisfied with
our good old friendship, which is so safe and sane.
</p>

<p>
I shall really be afraid to tell you of any of our
contretemps, you take them so seriously, and yet you
wish to know of all our wanderings and of just how
certain things impress us. I had forgotten about that
absurd homesickness in Genoa, until you spoke of it.
It was an acute attack, I assure you, and, like the
proverbial grief of the widower, violent while it
lasted, but soon well over and done with. Now we
wonder how any one could possibly be homesick in this
Italy which we love so much, above all in Rome, which
seems each day more and more the mother of us all.
Zelphine and Angela will tell you that Margaret is
the gayest of the party. You know that I never
would be a kill-joy, and here there is so much to interest
one on all sides.
</p>

<p>
So you are glad that there is one good English
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95'>95</a></span>
name in the party, and are pleased to like the sound
of my homespun baptismal? Angela is of the same
mind; she says that my sensible "Margaret" strikes
a happy balance between Zelphine's romantic name,
which she feels it her duty to live up to, and her
own, equally fanciful, which she takes pleasure in
defying. By way of adapting herself gracefully to the
situation, Angela has fallen into the habit of calling
Zelphine "Z." This is all very well, but I am thankful
that she does not insist upon being called "A.,"
as the constant turning from A. to Z. would be
unpleasantly suggestive of algebraic formulæ, which
were the bane of my school-days.
</p>

<p>
We laugh at Zelphine and chaff her continually
about her flights of fancy; but no person could travel
with her without realizing what a pleasure it is to be
with a woman whose mind is so stored with the poetry
and history of these old cities, one who enters so heart
and soul into every interesting association. I said
something of this to Angela one morning as we turned
from the Via Condotti into the Corso, feeling that she
might not appreciate all her privileges.
</p>

<p>
"Zelphine is," I said, "steeped in the lore of the
past."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, up to the neck!" replied Angela, with
emphasis. "I feel that I am now enjoying that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96'>96</a></span>
liberal education that I have heard about all my
life."
</p>

<p>
"The education is not liberal in including your expressions,"
I said, with an attempt at severity.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you understand, Margaret? Must I always
explain?" said Angela, lifting her innocent blue eyes
to mine. "I mean that Z. swims in learning, and one
must be in up to one's neck to swim comfortably!"
</p>

<p>
Angela is quite hopeless, and by way of punishing
her I stopped to buy her some of the delicious red
roses that make me think of June days at home, especially
of the roses in your mother's garden, which
were always the reddest. Zelphine having stepped on
in advance of us to attend to a commission at the
cleaner's, where they "gar auld claes look amaist as
weel's the new," we sauntered on along what one of
your favorite writers describes so enthusiastically as
"that world-famous avenue, the Corso."
</p>

<p>
"Do look at her!" exclaimed Angela, as we passed
the Via Convertite and saw Zelphine standing at the
corner of the Via San Claudio, gazing spellbound at
the windows of a house on the other side of the street.
"She's quite happy; time and place are nothing to
her&mdash;she has discovered the Shelley tablet on that
house. I saw it several days ago, but I thought I'd
let Z. find it for herself. She'll never rest content
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97'>97</a></span>
till she sees the room in which Shelley wrote 'The
Cenci' and 'Prometheus Unbound.' It is probably
not worth seeing when you get into it, and may not be
the room at all; but see it Z. will, or die in the attempt.
I don't believe in all these wonderful tales that we
hear. You only half believe in them yourself, Margaret,
so I dare to talk to you; Z. swallows them
whole, and so does Ludovico, and that is what makes
them such good friends."
</p>

<p>
"And is it your incredulity, my dear, that makes
you and Ludovico such bitter enemies?"
</p>

<p>
Angela laughed her light, musical laugh.
</p>

<p>
"We do quarrel, you know; we had quite a battle
last evening over the Catacombs. Ludovico says that
I must see them; that it would be positively disgraceful
for me to leave Rome without seeing the
Catacombs of Calixtus, at least. You know that I
don't care for such dismal places. Rome is so gay
and bright on top, why should we burrow underneath
after tombs and Christian martyrs, while the sun is
shining upon the Pincio and there are no end of things
to be seen above ground? There she goes, after the
concierge!"
</p>

<p>
There was nothing for us to do but to follow Zelphine
into the somewhat shabby house and upstairs
into the poet's room. It was worth much to stand in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98'>98</a></span>
the room where Shelley had once written, and to look
from the windows from which he could see the varied,
moving panorama of the busy Corso and the ancient
Church of San Silvestro in Capite, in whose adjoining
convent the beautiful Vittoria Colonna took refuge in
her widowhood, and wrote her sonnets in memory of
a beloved husband.
</p>

<p>
A curious commentary upon the power of the world
over the Church is to be found in the fact that Pope
Clement VII. forbade the abbess and nuns, "under
pain of the greater excommunication," to permit this
noble lady the usual solace of afflicted womanhood, the
cloister and the veil. This picturesque old convent
with its lovely cloisters is now used as a post office.
</p>

<p>
From Shelley's house we retraced our steps along
the Corso and turned into the Piazza San Lorenzo,
where is the little Church of San Lorenzo in Lucina,
in which Browning's Pompilia was baptized and married,
her "own particular place," where she wondered,
as we did,
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i9">"what the marble lion meant,</p>
<p class="i1">With half his body rushing from the wall,</p>
<p class="i1">Eating the figure of a prostrate man."</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Standing before the wonderful altar-piece of Guido
Reni's Crucifixion, painted against a wild and stormy
sky, we realized how the suffering face of the compassionate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99'>99</a></span>
Christ must have risen again and again before
the despairing eyes of the persecuted child-wife:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i13">"the piece
</p>
<p class="i1">
Of Master Guido Reni, Christ on Cross,
</p>
<p class="i1">
Second to nought observable in Rome."
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Other and more impressive associations with Shelley's
life in Rome than the little room on the Corso
we found this afternoon when we drove out to the
Baths of Caracalla, which even now cover so large a
space that they have been well named a city of pleasure.
We climbed over the mountainous ruin and up
the winding stairs, trying to find just such a perch as
Shelley described in the preface to his "Prometheus
Unbound."
</p>

<p>
Bald and naked are these walls to-day, but not
unsightly, as they stand out against the blue of the
Roman sky and the fresh green of the Campagna.
They are denuded of the vines and flowers that
adorned them when, as Shelley says, he wrote his
poem "among the flowery glades and thickets of
odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended, in
ever-winding labyrinths, upon its immense platforms
and dizzy arches suspended in the air."
</p>

<p>
Now as then Rome lies on one side, with her many
domes and towers; on the other are the mountains,
blue in the distance, and white beyond the blue, where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100'>100</a></span>
the snow lingers late upon their peaks. Like another
mountain stands out the dome of St. Peter's, which
Ampère says is "the only one of the works of man
that possesses something of the grandeur of the works
of God."
</p>

<p>
Being in the mood for poetic associations, we drove
around by the Porta San Paolo, just outside of which,
enclosed by high walls and overshadowed by the great
pyramidal Tomb of Caius Cestius, is the old Protestant
Cemetery. An ideal Campo Santo is this lovely
spot, of which Shelley wrote that "it might make one
in love with death to think that one should be buried
in so sweet a place." We wandered over the grass
and looked up at the sky through the trees, while
Zelphine quoted the lines that fit the scene so well:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">
"Pass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead
</p>
<p class="i1">
Thy footsteps to a slope of green access,
</p>
<p class="i1">
Where, like an infant's smile, over the dead
</p>
<p class="i1">
A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread."
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
And so passing from grave to grave we came to the
one we sought, and standing before a simple stone
slab, read those sad words which poor Keats, in bitterness
of spirit, wished to have written above his grave:
"Here lies one whose name was writ in water." It
was comforting to turn from this to a marble tablet
on the wall near by, where there is a head of Keats
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101'>101</a></span>
in low relief, and under it a beautiful inscription
saying that he is among the immortals. The young
poet's devoted friend Joseph Severn lies near him.
</p>

<p>
Across the road is the newer cemetery, whose gate
was opened for us by a girl with a huge key fastened
to her girdle, whom Zelphine and I likened to "the
damsel named Discretion." Angela, being a modern
girl and unfamiliar with "Pilgrim's Progress," did
not understand the allusion, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Small thanks to her if she is discreet, when she
is not able to say a word to us, good or bad!"
</p>

<p>
Zelphine always looks at me hopelessly on such
occasions, lamenting over what she calls the lack of
background in the outlook of the girl of to-day, whom
I always defend loyally although I believe Zelphine
is more than half right.
</p>

<p>
We found the grave of Shelley, who so soon followed
his Adonais. It seemed as if that lonely "Cor
Cordium" should have been buried near the friendly
shades of Keats and Severn. Yet Mrs. Shelley, in
writing of the burial of the ashes of her husband,
makes no mention of their being placed within the
newer cemetery. She simply says he selected the hallowed
place himself, where is the

</p>

<p>
It is so delightful to have some one with us who
knows and loves Rome as Ludovico does. He shows
us about <i>con amore</i> and with the greatest enthusiasm,
not in the perfunctory guide-book fashion. He and
Angela are already good friends, and chatter away
like two magpies about everything upon the earth and
beneath it as well, which is quite natural, as many of
our proposed excursions are subterranean, and we
never know what wonder of the world may be sprung
upon us at the next corner.
</p>

<p>
Ludovico was much pleased to learn that we had
not yet found our way to the Capitol, as he wished to
personally conduct us thither, advising us to drive to
the Piazza del Campidoglio in order to save the climb
up the long flight of steps leading to it from the street.
We thus missed the first view from below of the noble
statue of Marcus Aurelius, which was once gilded
over, like some of our modern statues, and stood near
the Lateran. Those old sculptors knew how a ruler
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103'>103</a></span>
should look! You must see this statue of your grand
old heathen emperor some day; there is majesty and
dominance in every line.
</p>

<p>
In the museum we passed beautiful bas-reliefs representing
classic scenes, the colossal statue of the
Emperor Hadrian in armor, and sarcophagi strangely
decorated with bacchanalian representations, until we
suddenly found ourselves in the Room of the Dying
Gladiator, with that wonderful marble figure before
us of which Byron wrote:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">
"He recked not of the life he lost, nor prize,
</p>
<p class="i1">
But where his rude hut by the Danube lay,
</p>
<p class="i1">
There were his young barbarians all at play,
</p>
<p class="i1">
There was their Dacian mother&mdash;he, their sire,
</p>
<p class="i1">
Butchered to make a Roman holiday."
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
We lingered long beside this impressive marble, and
then turned to the Resting Satyr of Praxiteles, made
familiar to us all by Hawthorne's description. You
remember that Donatello so strongly resembled the
statue that Miriam begged him to shake aside his
thick curls and allow her to see whether he had the
Faun's leaf-shaped pointed ears. This he declined to
do, saying, as he danced around the statue of the
Dying Gladiator, "I shall be like a wolf of the Apennines
if you touch my ears ever so softly. None of
my race could endure it."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104'>104</a></span>
</p>

<p>
If, as Hawthorne says, "only a sculptor of the
finest imagination, the most delicate taste, the sweetest
feeling, and the rarest artistic skill&mdash;in a word, a
sculptor and a poet too&mdash;could have first dreamed of a
faun in this guise, and then have succeeded in imprisoning
the sportive and frisky thing in marble," surely
none but a novelist and a poet too could have presented
on the page of romance this creature of the
woods and hills, half man, half animal, the sensitive,
emotional, whimsical, and altogether fascinating Donatello.
</p>

<p>
The statues of the Faun, the Dying Gladiator, and
the beautiful youth Antinous are all among the treasures
of which Hadrian's Villa was despoiled, as was
also the exquisite mosaic of doves on a fountain basin,
called Pliny's Doves, because, in speaking of the perfection
to which the mosaic art had attained, Pliny
described a wonderful mosaic in which one dove is
drinking and casting her shadow in the water while
others are pluming themselves on the edge of the vase.
While in the room of the Doves we paid our respects
to the Capitoline Venus, which, although considered a
perfect type of feminine grace, failed to appeal to us
as did the Venus della Coscia in the Naples Museum,
and is, of course, not to be mentioned in the same
breath with the lovely armless lady of the Louvre.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105'>105</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After spending two hours in the museum, Zelphine
said that she had seen enough for one day, and that
her mind refused to grasp anything more. We usually
find that this is quite time enough to spend in any
picture-gallery or museum, and I am inclined to think
that people who stay longer wear themselves out to
no purpose.
</p>

<p>
Angela suggested that as we were so near the
Church of Ara C&oelig;li, it would be well to go to see the
wonderful Bambino. Ludovico prepared us for some
disappointment by telling us that the most interesting
time to visit this church is during the Epiphany,
when the Bambino lies in a manger and little children
come here and recite poems in its honor. But as a
Christmas visit was only a remote possibility, we
concluded to climb up to this church, hung like an
eagle's nest upon the precipitous rock, and well named
the "Altar of Heaven." Zelphine quite forgot her
fatigue when she read in her guide-book that it was in
this church that Edward Gibbon first conceived the
idea of writing his "Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire," while Ludovico, by way of giving us something
cheerful to think of, told us that at the foot
of the steps Tiberius Gracchus and Cola di Rienzi
were both slain by their nobles. There is a statue of
Rienzi in the piazza below, and above is that wonderful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106'>106</a></span>
group of the horse-taming Dioscuri, your
copies of which have always interested me so much.
A curious and most unromantic association with these
steps is that here the monks of the Ara C&oelig;li, who were
famous dentists, used to perform their hideous but
useful operations, out in the open, before the eyes of
the passer-by. It appears that the Romans of this
time were denied the alleviating circumstance of enduring
their miseries in private. Zelphine, who has a
pleasant habit of counting her blessings, finds just
here another reason for offering up thanks that she
lives in this year of grace 1904 rather than in that
ancient and less comfortable period.
</p>

<p>
As the steps are many and the sun was hot we were
warm and out of breath when we reached the top,
and were glad of the coolness and peace that we found
inside. I gave Angela an admonitory look before
the Bambino was displayed, fearing that she might
do or say something to hurt Ludovico's feelings. As
it happened, however, he seemed to care even less
about it than we did, although he told us, with his
usual simplicity and directness, that "il Santissimo
Bambino," as he calls it, is carefully guarded, not
on account of its rich clothing and jewels, but because
a woman once formed the design of appropriating to
herself the baby image and its benefits. "She had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107'>107</a></span>
another bambino prepared, of the same size and general
appearance as this," said Ludovico, looking at
the fresh-colored, richly dressed doll. "She pretended
to be ill, and so got possession of the Santissimo.
She dressed the false image in the garments of
the true Bambino, and sent it back to Ara C&oelig;li. That
night the most remarkable thing happened: the monks
were awakened by a wild ringing of bells at the west
door of the church, and what should they find there
but the little, shivering, naked figure of the Santissimo
Bambino, in the wind and rain! Of course, the false
bambino was sent back to its owner, and now the Santissimo
is never taken away from the church unattended.
This is easy enough, as the Bambino has its
own carriage, coachman, and footman, and makes its
visits to the sick in great state."
</p>

<p>
I glanced at Angela. Amusement and incredulity
were all too plainly visible on that fair young face, so
I hastened to suggest that we look at some of the beautiful
tombs. There are several by Donatello and the
Cosmati so exquisitely sculptured that they alone
repay a visit to the church. From the terrace outside
we looked down on the Forum below us, where to-day
a great mass of blue iris flowers were waving and
dancing in the breeze under the very shadow of the
three columns of the Temple of Castor and Pollux.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108'>108</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Ludovico suggested our going to the Tarpeian Rock,
which is part of this precipitous hill, if we were not
too tired. No, we were not too tired; the many steps of
the Ara C&oelig;li seemed to have brought positive refreshment
to Zelphine, who announced herself ready for
a new start, and so, through delightful winding ways
known only to the initiated, Ludovico led us to the
garden from which we looked down upon the Tarpeian
Rock.
</p>

<p>
Do you remember the picture in our school histories
of Marcus Curtius plunging into the abyss?
I could see him, in my mind's eye, boldly riding his
white horse over the cliff into the depths of the chasm
below, until Zelphine reminded me that it was not
from this rock that Curtius made his fatal plunge,
but over on the Forum, where the chasm closed at
once upon horse and rider. I cannot even find
mention of our old friend Marcus Curtius; he is
now known as Mettius Curtius. Now the edge of
the precipice is so guarded by an iron railing that
it would be quite impossible in these days for any
one to leap from the rock, or for Donatello to push
the monk over into the street below, as in Hawthorne's
tale. Mr. Julian Hawthorne says that it was
to a moonlight visit to the Tarpeian Rock in the good
company of Miss Bremer that we owe this scene in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109'>109</a></span>
"The Marble Faun," the "most visibly tragic of
my father's writings." A pleasant-faced young woman
who unlocked the gate of the garden for us was
evidently bewitched by Angela's charms, as she did
not take her eyes off her face from the moment that
she saw her. When we turned to leave the enclosure
she broke from one of the trees an exquisite branch of
orange-blossoms, and gave it to Angela with a charming
grace, at the same time glancing over at Ludovico
in a manner that brought the color to his face. He
laughed, evidently pleased, and said a few words to
her in Italian, after which she bestowed a smaller
cluster of the fragrant flowers upon him. Angela, all
unconscious, walked on, revelling in the rich perfume
of these loveliest of blossoms.
</p>

<p>
I went to sleep last night wondering what the sweet-faced
custodian of the grim rock had said to Ludovico,
and what his reply had been, and so fell to dreaming
of a wedding; but Zelphine was the bride, not Angela,
despite her orange-blossoms, and the groom was a certain
widower who pays intermittent attention to Zelphine&mdash;intermittent
because she will not allow him to
be a "regular steady," as one of our maids used to
say in speaking of her own suitor.
</p>

<p>
You have surely heard of Walter Leonard's devotion
to Zelphine, which is so much of an open secret
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110'>110</a></span>
among her friends that when subjects for conversation
fail, they fall back with ever fresh interest upon
speculations as to whether or not she will eventually
accept him and his family of small children. Angela
and I have an idea that she left home in order to avoid
a crisis in her affairs, and when she looks sad or tired,
Angela says that remorse is preying upon her because
of the motherless condition of those hapless children.
I did not tell Zelphine about my dream, because it is
bad luck to dream about a marriage. You scorn all
such fancies, I know, but she is really superstitious,
and I might injure Mr. Leonard's chances if I should
talk just now. Angela and I have our own fun out of
the situation. She predicts that he will appear in
Venice, which surely would be an appropriate place
for a lover to make his entrance, and romantic enough
to please Zelphine. This is only idle talk, however,
as she has never spoken of the possibility of Walter
Leonard's coming over; and pray do forget my gossip.
It is too late, and I am quite too tired to rewrite this
part of my letter. I know you of old, and so am sure
that you will tell no tales.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
Sunday, March 27th.
</p>

<p>
This is a gloriously beautiful day. The Spanish
Steps are brilliant in the sunshine, with more flowers
than usual on the stalls at the base. As Sunday is a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111'>111</a></span>
fête-day, the vendors do a thriving business. And
how cheap the flowers are! One may have all the
roses one can carry, for a franc or two! Yet, with
the idea that there is no fixed price in Italy, travellers
are always to be seen at the stalls outdoing the
Romans themselves in their efforts to cheapen the
flowers, while the merchant volubly protests that his
house will be desolated and his children in rags if he
sells his roses for a soldo less than the asking price.
A few artists' models are still to be found sunning
themselves on the marble steps or around the fountain
of the Piazza di Spagna, but in less brilliant array
than one would desire, peasant dress being as little
worn in Rome as in Paris.
</p>

<p>
To go to St. Peter's seemed the thing of all others
to do to-day, and we found an accommodating tram
waiting for us in the Piazza di Spagna.
</p>

<p>
They tell us that no one ever realizes the vastness
of St. Peter's upon a first visit. However this may
be, it seemed immense to us, outside and in. One
notices first Bernini's great colonnades on each side
of the basilica, which, with its façade, form a hemicycle
with the Egyptian obelisk in the centre. Behind
the church is the monotonous mass of the Vatican
buildings, while in the foreground the twin
fountains send up their spires of feathery spray.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112'>112</a></span>
Small wonder that the practical and thrifty German
Emperor advised them to turn off the water. "Turn
them off now," he said, after admiring the beauty of
the fountains. "It's a pity to waste so much water!"
But these fountains of Maderno's have played
untiringly, in sunlight and shade, by moonlight and
starlight, for nearly three hundred years. Everywhere
in Rome one hears the sound of flowing water
from the many fountains. In the Borghese Gardens
up on the Pincio, in the Piazza di Spagna, down in
the Piazza Poli where the great Fountain of Trevi
dashes continually, throwing its <i>jets d'eau</i> into the
great basin beneath, over in the Piazza delle Terme,
near the railroad station&mdash;on all sides one hears the
refreshing sound of splashing, leaping water.
</p>

<p>
We wandered about the great basilica as if in a
strange city, avoiding, of course, the several chapels
in which services were being held, and stopping long
before the Chapel of the Pietà, in which Michael
Angelo's beautiful marble of the Sorrowing Mother
with the dead Christ upon her knees is enshrined.
From the gorgeous mosaics in Michael Angelo's dome
and from the rich and elaborate tombs of many popes
we turned almost with relief to the strong and simple
Rezzonico monument, upon which Canova has placed
two great lions at the feet of Pope Clement XIII.,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113'>113</a></span>
while in sharp contrast is a graceful, youthful figure,
the Genius of Death, holding a torch reversed.
Zelphine and I think this the most beautiful example
of Canova's work that we have seen anywhere. Another
of the monuments that interested us is that
erected by George IV. to the memory of the unfortunate
princes of the house of Stuart, James III.,
Charles Edward, and Henry, Cardinal of York.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine, who adores the Stuarts, almost wept over
this tomb, although she could not help smiling a bit
at the high-sounding titles engraved upon the monument
to Maria Clementina Sobieski, the wife of the
second Pretender, whose name is here inscribed as
"Queen of Great Britain, France, and Ireland."
</p>

<p>
We both enjoyed Stendhal's trenchant comment
upon the post-mortem honors paid by the Hanoverian
king to the Stuart princes: "<span lang='fr_FR'>George IV., fidèle à sa
réputation du <i>gentleman</i> le plus accompli des trois
royaumes, a voulu honorer la cendre des princes malheureuses
que de leur vivant il eût envoyés à l'échafaud
s'ils fussent tombés en son pouvoir.</span>"
</p>

<p>
The temporary tomb of the late Pope is in this part
of St. Peter's, near the monument of Innocent III.
The permanent resting-place of Leo XIII. is to be in
St. John Lateran; for this tomb Tadolini is preparing
a magnificent monument.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114'>114</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We drove from St. Peter's, by the Tiber, passing
the Castle of St. Angelo, where Ludovico took us yesterday
to show us the pitiful little cell in which poor
Beatrice Cenci was imprisoned. We had already seen
her lovely, sad picture at the Barberini Palace. The
exquisite, haunting beauty of the Cenci portrait is
quite indescribable. As Charles Dickens says,
"Through the transcendent sweetness and beauty of
her face there is something shining out that haunts
me. I see it now as I see this paper or my pen."
</p>

<p>
This afternoon we drove for an hour or more in
the Borghese Gardens, after which we went to the
evening service at the American Church in the Via
Nazionale, which naturally looked somewhat cold and
plain after the gorgeous color and decoration of St.
Peter's. It was, however, restful and homelike to sit
there and listen to the beautiful service of our own
church.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine says that Catholic visitors in Rome are
especially fortunate, as for them the path of duty
and the path of pleasure lie side by side, leading them
always into the most beautiful churches and giving
them the satisfying combination of art and religion.
I entirely agree with her, having often felt that in a
service in Westminster Abbey an element of adventure
was added to the act of devotion. I think it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115'>115</a></span>
you who told me of a Scotchwoman who considered a
service in the abbey "among the images" too much
of a diversion for a Sabbath day. I should think that
good Catholic travellers might have somewhat the
same feeling about a great ceremonial at St. Peter's.
</p>

<p>
In the Borghese Gardens, the shadows under the
ilex-trees were most lovely this afternoon, the sunshine
filtering through the branches here and there, flecking
the green sward with spots of light, and bringing
out the color of the anemones which grow here in
such profusion. We could readily fancy Miriam and
Donatello dancing in this sylvan shade, although no
vagrant musicians were waking the echoes among the
leafy coverts, no herdsman in goatskin breeches, no
peasants from the Campagna, or pretty <i>contadine</i>
appeared, to add a touch of local color to the natural
beauties of the scene.

<h2>
VIII
<br />

VIA APPIA
</h2>
<hr class="l30" />

<p class="ralign">
Monday, March 28th.
</p>

<p>
Ludovico proposed that we should take the long-talked-of
drive along the Via Appia this beautiful
afternoon. Knowing Angela's objection to subterranean
excursions, he discreetly said nothing about the
Catacombs, although I realized well that they were
uppermost in his mind, and felt that I might safely
trust a bit of diplomacy to this clever little Italian.
</p>

<p>
As we are living in the north-eastern part of Rome
and the Via Appia is in the southern part, leading
toward the Pontine Marshes and ancient Brundusium,
we had a long drive across the city. We drove through
the Corso as far as the Piazza Colonna, with its towering
column erected by the Senate and the people in
honor of your hero Marcus Aurelius, and then by
smaller streets and squares to the Porta Capena. Of
this gate, which is associated with so many interesting
events, only fragmentary ruins remain. Near it were
once grouped temples of Mars and Hercules and the
tomb of the young sister of the Horatii, who was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117'>117</a></span>
betrothed to one of the Curiatii. Ludovico repeated
the sad little story, which we had all read in our
school-days, of the girl coming out to meet her brother
Horatius at the Porta Capena. When she saw the
cloak wrought by her own hands borne by Horatius,
she wept, as any other girl would have done, knowing
that her lover was dead; upon which the cruel Horatius
stabbed her to the heart, crying, "So perish the
Roman maiden who shall weep her country's enemy!"
</p>

<p>
To see the place where this sad scene was enacted
and the site of the grave of the hapless maiden made
it seem as real as if it had occurred last year instead
of&mdash;how many hundred years ago? We are realizing,
as never before, what an old world this is. Even
now, out in the Forum, they are opening the graves of
men and women who lived before Romulus, as if the
Rome of Numa and the Cæsars was not old enough for
all antiquarian uses!
</p>

<p>
The old Romans, like the ancient Egyptians, seem
to have had no shrinking from keeping death well in
view, as this Via Appia, which was the patrician cemetery
of Rome, was also a military highway and a pleasure-drive,
and from it still branches a road leading to
the race-course. Indeed, there is nothing dismal about
this "way of tombs," for the road is wide, paved with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118'>118</a></span>
large blocks of stone, and flanked by vineyards. On
the right are the Baths of Caracalla, on the left are
the tombs of the Scipios, while the long bridge-like
ruins of the old aqueduct rise here and there above
the level of the Campagna, and beyond, framing all,
are the mountains. Flowers are blooming along the
sides of the road, among the tombs and over them.
Angela and Ludovico gathered a large bunch of cyclamen
and the purple lady's-slipper orchids. Wherever
there is an unsightly stone or a bit of broken wall,
Nature has generously covered it with a drapery of
green vines or white banksia roses.
</p>

<p>
Here, out in the sunshine and among the flowers,
are the tombs of the grand old heathen, while the good
Christians sleep in the dismal subterranean Catacombs.
Is not this another example of the way in
which the ancient pagan city dominates the Rome of
later times?
</p>

<p>
A little way beyond the fine tombs of the Scipios
we passed through the Arch of Drusus, with its equestrian
statue and trophies, on whose summit is still a
bit of the aqueduct by which Caracalla carried water
to his baths. A little beyond the Porta San Sebastiano
we came to the small Church of Domine Quo
Vadis. You may remember the story which led to its
foundation. During a great persecution of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119'>119</a></span>
Christians, under Nero, some of St. Peter's converts
and devoted friends besought him not to expose his
life by remaining in Rome. Peter finally listened to
their counsels and fled along the Appian Way; but
about two miles from the gate he was met by a vision
of the Saviour, journeying towards the city. Filled
with amazement, Peter exclaimed, "Domine, quo
vadis?" "Lord, whither goest Thou?" To this
question his Master replied, sadly, "I go to Rome to
be crucified a second time," and vanished. Peter,
accepting this as a sign that he was to submit to the
sufferings that menaced him, turned back to Rome
and met his fate. Hence the little yellow church of
Domine Quo Vadis, which was built to mark the
sacred spot.
</p>

<p>
We left the carriage and entered the church, as
Zelphine wished to see the sacred footprints upon the
stone pavement; but Ludovico told her that those
impressions were only copies, the originals being at
the Church of St. Sebastian. We walked on and on
along the Via Appia, glad to tread the same stones
that had been pressed by the feet of St. Peter, St.
Paul, and so many great ones of the earth.
</p>

<p>
We were so much absorbed in the associations of the
road, and had such unbounded confidence in our
young guide, that we did not even ask where we were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120'>120</a></span>
going, although I suspected that Ludovico was about
to enact his <i>coup d'état</i> for Angela's benefit. Through
a gateway shaded by cypresses we followed him into a
rose-garden, with a chapel to the left and a booth
opposite, where were displayed a number of odd and
discordant relics. Here Ludovico stopped to buy some
tickets, and then we descended many steps into darkness
made somewhat visible by the light of curious
little spiral tapers, <i>cerini</i>, which we carried.
</p>

<p>
Light seemed to dawn upon Angela's mind when
the taper was handed to her at the entrance; she
turned and shook her finger at Ludovico, exclaiming,
"The Catacombs!" I felt at first that it was not
quite fair to have beguiled the child here, against her
will, to this dismal home of the dead, which cannot
fail to impress a sensitive nature. Afterwards, however,
Angela was so much interested in the little
chapels in which the early Christians worshipped, with
the paintings on the walls and the symbols of the fish,
the dove, and the anchor over many of the tombs, that
she quite forgot her terror.
</p>

<p>
The guide explained that these Catacombs of St.
Calixtus include several columbaria, there being forty
separate catacombs extending under the city, covering,
according to Michele de Rossi's calculations, an
area of 615 acres. The city of the dead is far greater
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121'>121</a></span>
than the city of the living; but this is not to be wondered
at, considering the population of Rome under
the Cæsars and the large number of converts to Christianity.
</p>

<p>
We were surprised to find the air mild, not chill and
damp as one would expect in underground passages.
Although there are wires for electric lights in some of
the corridors, the Catacombs are not lighted by electricity.
It was introduced five years ago, but was
found to be impracticable, as the wires were soon
injured by rust; hence we were spared this incongruity.
Despite the many tales we had read of travellers
being lost in the Catacombs, we never once
thought of the danger, although our guide told us
more than once that it would be well for us to keep
close together.
</p>

<p>
He took us into a chapel containing the tombs of
some of the early martyred popes, as St. Fabian, St.
Lucius, and St. Sextus. In some of these chapels, or
cubicula, are beautiful inscriptions to Pope Damasus,
whose labor of love it was to restore and preserve these
tombs of the Christians. At the end of a long inscription
over the door of one of the largest of these
sepulchral chambers, which records that here lie
heaped together a number of the holy ones, the good
Pope has humbly added:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122'>122</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">
"Here I, Damasus, wished to have laid my limbs,
</p>
<p class="i1">
But feared to disturb the holy ashes of the saints."
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
We then entered a chamber with an air-shaft above,
like most of the cubicula, where, on the walls, were a
number of Byzantine paintings of St. Urban, St. Cecilia,
and a head of Christ. The guide told us that this
chamber contained the remains of St. Cecilia until
they were removed to the Church of Santa Cecilia in
Trastevere. Without a word of warning, Ludovico
drew us across the room to a niche in the wall, where
we saw, lying upon her side, the loveliest of girlish
figures. The first impression, in the semi-obscurity,
with all the light falling on the recumbent figure, was
that of a veiled woman asleep.
</p>

<p>
"Santa Cecilia!" said Ludovico, in a hushed voice.
Zelphine bent forward as if ready to fall on her knees,
when the official guide broke the reverent silence by
reciting in a sing-song tone, but in quite comprehensible
English:
</p>

<p>
"This rich Roman lady was sentenced to death by
the prefect of Rome because she would not sacrifice to
idols. After trying to smother the lady in her own
bath, but not succeeding, because the saints were
watching over her, a lictor was sent to cut off her
head; but the saints took the strength out of his arm
and he only wounded her, after which she lived three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123'>123</a></span>
days preaching to the people. Step nearer and you
will see the wound on the lady's neck. It is partially
covered by a gold necklace."
</p>

<p>
In the sixteenth century the tomb of St. Cecilia was
opened, and her embalmed body was found, beautiful
and perfect, as if asleep in her own bed rather than
lying in a tomb. Pope Clement III. and all Rome
went to the Catacombs to look upon the saint, and Stefano
Maderno, the greatest sculptor of his time, was
called upon to model the marble statue of the lovely
sleeping saint. Maderno's original statue of St. Cecilia
we had seen in the Church of St. Cecilia in Trastevere,
and also the artist's inscription, in which he says
that he has modelled her in the very same posture
of body as that in which she was found lying incorrupt
in her tomb. Beautiful as is the marble in the
church, it failed to impress us as did this replica in
the appropriate setting of the cubiculum.
</p>

<p>
Tears were in our eyes as we turned away, and I
heard Angela say to Ludovico, in her softest tone,
"It is the most real thing I have seen in Rome!"
</p>

<p>
"Ludovico has good reason to be pleased with the
success of his strategy," whispered Zelphine, and then,
wishing to carry away undisturbed this exquisite
memory of St. Cecilia, we made our way out toward
the open, where we found our carriage awaiting us.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124'>124</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We were all very subdued, for pleasure-seekers,
and were silent as we drove on past the vast tomb of
Cæcilia, the daughter of Metellus and the beloved wife
of the younger Crassus. Above the inscription are
Gallic trophies which belonged to the elder Crassus,
who was Cæsar's legate in Gaul. The tomb itself, a
great round tower seventy feet in diameter, seems
more like a fortress than a tomb, and we were not
surprised to learn that the monument of this noble
Roman lady had been used as a fortress in the thirteenth
century.
</p>

<p>
Beyond this tomb, whose mystery and charm have
inspired many a poet, the natural beauties of the
Appian Way begin, as the vineyard walls no longer
interrupt the more extended view over the Latin plain,
with its ruined castles, villages, and aqueducts. When
we had driven past the fifth mile-stone, near which
are the tombs of the Horatii and the vast ruins of the
Villa of Commodus, we were warned by a delicate, violet
mist which was rising over the Campagna that it
was time to turn towards Rome. Good Romans tell us
that their city is perfectly healthful now, since the
marshes have been drained, and so it seems to be; but
it is always a question whether it is wise to linger
near the Campagna about sunset, as we usually notice
a chill dampness in the air at this time.

<p class="ralign">
Thursday, March 31st.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. M., my old friend Rosalie L., has come from
Sorrento to spend Holy Week and Easter with us.
Dr. M. has a professional engagement which will
detain him for a week or ten days, and in the interim
we four are visiting churches most assiduously. There
are interesting Tenebræ services in nearly all the
churches this week. This rainy afternoon we went to
Santa Maria Maggiore, which is one of the most beautiful
and harmonious buildings we have seen. The
mosaics are very rich, and the Borghese Chapel is
gorgeous with precious marbles and alabaster. Here
above an altar of jasper and lapis lazuli is the famous
picture of the Virgin said to have been painted by St.
Luke. It is much revered, not only on account of its
origin, but because of its having, according to tradition,
stopped the plague in Rome and brought about
the overthrow of the Moorish dominion in Spain.
</p>

<p>
At St. Peter's, where we went later in the afternoon
to hear the fine music, a lock of the Virgin's hair was
exhibited, a piece of the true cross, and St. Veronica's
handkerchief. I trust you will never cross-examine
me upon the color of the Virgin's hair, and to forestall
any such inquiries, I here frankly confess that I did
not really see it, as the sacred relics were displayed
from a high balcony over the great statue of St. Veronica.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126'>126</a></span>
The handkerchief we did see, and the face of the
Saviour on it, which was distinct. The basilica, near
the high altar, was crowded; poor people and soldiers
were kneeling beside richly dressed Roman ladies;
many of the <i>forestieri</i>, like ourselves, were standing
about, gazing at the strange sights, and some of them,
I regret to say, were talking.
</p>

<p>
Rosalie, Zelphine, and I were interested, as indeed
we always are, in watching the poor people, who are
so attentive and devout, so much in earnest, coming to
their churches as to a home. Groups of little children
came in holding each other's hands, some of them
bringing with them little toddling things of two and
three. The face of one little girl I shall never forget,
she was so exquisitely beautiful, with the loveliness
of childhood and yet with a womanly seriousness in
her dark eyes. Rosalie and I imagined Dante's Beatrice
looking something like this little girl, and could
understand his cherishing in his heart the image of
that woman-child all his days.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
Easter Sunday, April 3d.
</p>

<p>
We are glad to have a bright Easter Day, and enjoy
it the more because Holy Week has been dark and
rainy. We went to the English Church on the Via del
Babuino in the morning, and in the afternoon to St.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127'>127</a></span>
Peter's, to witness a procession of the priests which
was somewhat disappointing. We then turned into
the Pincio, which was a blaze of color with Judas-trees,
wistaria, roses, and anemones. All Rome was
in evidence. This is one of the few days in the year
when the King and Queen drive out together in state.
Angela and I were too late to see them, but Zelphine
was more fortunate, as she passed them when she was
driving with her cousins. She thought the Queen
exceedingly pretty, youthful, and charming.
</p>

<p>
The well-to-do people were <i>en voiture</i> drawn up in
line, the poor on foot crowding the walks and benches
near the music-stand, where the band was playing
merrily; a good-natured, cheerful crowd, and gayer,
it seemed to me, than the same class of people in Paris.
Nothing on the Pincio is more picturesque than the
nurses in their full skirts of gay colors, with their
luxuriant black hair decorated with bright ribbons
and gold combs and pins. They look very stylish
carrying the aristocratic bambini on pillows. We are
told that these unfortunate babies are still swaddled
like those in Della Robbia's terra-cottas.
</p>

<p>
In the meadows adjoining the Borghese Gardens
the students of the different colleges were playing
ball. Do you wonder that Italian immigrants find our
Sundays insupportably dull? Here it is a fête-day all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128'>128</a></span>
the year, and to-day being the feast of feasts, the
people have come out to enjoy themselves in the sunshine.
What would your father think of it all, Allan,
and your Scotch grandmother? I could feel the
shadow of her displeasure darkening the sunshine as
I stood in the midst of this joyous crowd, and yet,
after all, it seems an innocent way of spending a
beautiful Sunday afternoon.

<p>
A grand and elaborate Gregorian ceremonial is to
be held in St. Peter's on Monday, the eleventh, and, as
you may imagine, <i>tout le monde</i>, the small world as
well as the great, is rushing after tickets. We were
able to secure the white entrance cards from our
banker on the Piazza di Spagna, with which we were
quite satisfied until Miss Dean, the charming Irish
lady who sits next to me at the table d'hôte, showed
me a yellow <i>biglietto</i>, which assures her a seat in the
tribunes. Since then we have been filled with envy,
hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness. We did not
at all understand the difference between the white
<i>ingresso</i> cards and the yellow until she explained it,
with a delicious rolling of the <i>r</i> in <i>ingresso</i> such as
even Angela, with all her aptitude for mimicking, is
unable to attain. The white tickets simply give one an
entrée to the church, the yellow, which come only to
the favored few, are for seats in the tribunes. Recalling
Madame Waddington's description of her own
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130'>130</a></span>
sufferings and those of the other diplomatic ladies at
the coronation of the Czar Alexander III., we earnestly
hope that we may be so fortunate as to have seats
in one of the tribunes.
</p>

<p>
Ludovico, who has been rushing hither and thither
for several days, trying to secure tickets for us
through his godfather, who is one of the Pope's chamberlains,
came in this evening, his face flushed with
the joy of victory. I knew that he had secured the
coveted <i>biglietti</i>, as soon as I saw him. There was,
however, a shade of embarrassment in his manner
which I could not quite understand. The reason
became evident when Ludovico pulled two tickets,
instead of three, out of his pocket, explaining with
much hesitation that it was impossible to get more
than two even from his official godfather, so great
was the demand. We all three made haste to say,
with proper politeness, that it was a great deal to have
two tickets for such an occasion and to ask where
was his own; to which he replied that there were no
places in the tribunes for men. Did we not see that
printed on the <i>biglietti</i>? He would go, of course, and
stand about, or secure a perch on one of the great
columns.
</p>

<p>
Although we were perfectly civil in our expressions
to Ludovico, and, I trust, sufficiently grateful for a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131'>131</a></span>
favor to which we could lay no possible claim, we
were wondering how we could make two tickets answer
for three women, all equally anxious to see the great
ceremonies. Unlike the dame who was expected to
fry her ten fish in nine separate pans at the same
moment, we were unwilling "to give it up," and so
continued to discuss the problem after we went to our
rooms that night. Zelphine and I said most decidedly
that Angela should go, at which she opened her eyes
wide and asked why, adding, "I was always told
that the older children should go everywhere and the
younger ones stay at home, on the same principle as
the helping at table. Being one of the older children,
this has always seemed to me a perfectly fair arrangement,
and I have never doubted the propriety of having
my younger brothers eat the drumsticks."
</p>

<p>
"In the first place," said Zelphine, in her most
judicial manner, "as you are so much younger, you
will probably live longer to tell the tale."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think that is much of an argument,"
replied Angela stoutly. "The young occasionally die,
and you are neither of you very aged, and you are
both much giddier and more frivolous than I. Indeed,
I sometimes wonder&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
You will never know the cause of Angela's wonder,
because I interrupted her:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132'>132</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"After all, don't you think we had better consider
Ludovico in this matter? Is it likely that he would
travel all over Rome for days to get tickets for two
old-er women?" I started to say "old," but I saw
Zelphine wince, and so compromised on "older."
"It is quite natural that a youth like Ludovico should
wish to please the young lady of the party, and I
must confess that although he handed the tickets to
me, he looked at Angela for a smile of thanks, which
she never vouchsafed him."
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't so very much to do," said Angela,
laughingly, but with a tone of yielding in her voice.
"He had only to go to his godfather and ask him for
some tickets."
</p>

<p>
"Ungrateful child," I exclaimed, "is there any
service that you would consider too great to be performed
at your behest? I firmly believe that if Ludovico
should bring you a wagon-load of roses from
Queen Margherita's own garden you would simply
raise your eyebrows and say, 'How charming! I
never had quite so many roses; I hope you have been
at no inconvenience in gathering them.'"
</p>

<p>
"What a picture!" exclaimed Angela, "and what
an imagination you have, Margaret! And what darlings
you both are!" With which the spoiled child
kissed us both, and dismissed us to our slumbers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133'>133</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"That is what comes of being a beauty," said Zelphine,
"but with Angela's charm and cleverness nothing
is really too good for her."
</p>

<p>
"Zelphine, you are quite as bad as the Italians
over Angela's blonde head. I only trust that we may
get her home without any love-affairs or duels; but she
must go on Monday, <i>coûte que coûte</i>!"

Something has just happened that has forcibly
impressed me with the wisdom of your favorite proverb
about crossing bridges before one comes to them&mdash;a
most delightful happening this! Dr. M. came in
this evening to say that Rosalie had two tickets for
the tribunes, and would I go with her? Of course I
accepted with great alacrity, and we are all to set
forth together to-morrow. Dr. M. and Ludovico will
accompany us to the entrance to the church, when
they and the other male barbarians will find such
places as they may. I really feel sorry for Dr. M.,
who may never be here again upon such an occasion;
but then he would probably not be willing to change
places with any one of us, even with Angela, and I&mdash;well,
I have never been quite so glad to be a woman
as I am now. We do have some privileges, although
Miss Susan B. Anthony would say that all of them,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134'>134</a></span>
when weighed in the balance against the right of
suffrage, are lighter than vanity.
</p>

<p>
Miss Dean informed me at dinner last night that
the Earl and Countess of Denbigh, with their two
young sons, have come to assist at the service to-morrow.
From the expression of awe in her enchanting
voice, I am sure that my charming neighbor feels that
the pension and everything in it is honored by the presence
of this peer and peeress of ancient lineage; but
as these noble folk lunch and dine in their own parlor,
we have only the uplifting consciousness that they
pass through the same hall and go up and down in
the same <i>ascenseur</i> (when it runs at all) upon their
goings out and comings in. This, however, seems to
fill to the brim the cup of content of my Irish friend.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
April 11th.
</p>

<p>
We were all up betimes this morning, and were on
our way to St. Peter's before eight o'clock. I must
here confess to a quite pardonable pride in the appearance
of my companions. Zelphine and Mrs. M., in
long black gowns which accentuated their tall slenderness,
with handsome lace at the neck and sleeves and
the regulation black lace scarf most coquettishly
draped over their white pompadours, looked like fair
and noble ladies of the court of Louis Quinze on their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135'>135</a></span>
way to mass at the Sainte Chapelle or Notre Dame.
Angela, who owned no black gown, had borrowed one
of mine, which she had tucked in and let out and generally
readjusted until it became her as everything
does that she puts on her graceful figure. The sombreness
of her dress and veil served to bring out the
gold of the girl's hair and the whiteness of her skin,
and with a delicate flush on her cheek, like the inside
of a shell, she looked like one of the beings whose
name she bears.
</p>

<p>
Ludovico evidently had the same thought. Touched
by the girl's beauty, after the manner of his beauty-loving
race, he bent over Angela and repeated the
old story of the three prisoners from Britain whose
fair faces and blonde heads drew from Pope Gregory
the exclamation, "Non Angli sed angeli!" "And
this," added Ludovico, devoutly, "as you know, led
to the Christianizing of Britain."
</p>

<p>
By the time Ludovico had finished his story we had
reached the Borgo Nuovo. At the Piazza Rusticucci
there was so long a line of carriages that we abandoned
ours, and passed on foot through Bernini's
lofty colonnade, and on by wicked Caligula's grand
obelisk out into the vastness of the piazza, spanned
to-day by the most perfect of Italian skies, into
whose ethereal blueness Maderno's noble fountains
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136'>136</a></span>
were trying which one could throw its spray the
highest.
</p>

<p>
It is a privilege to see St. Peter's at any time, but
to see it to-day, with the great piazza filled with soldiers
and the vast, surging, swaying throng of people,
is an inspiration as well as a joy. The varied uniforms
of the soldiers and guards and the gowns of the
different seminarists, blue, green, purple, and, above
all, the brilliant scarlet gowns of the German students,
against the gray background of the great basilica,
added much to the picturesqueness of the scene.
</p>

<p>
At the top of the great steps leading to the vestibule
Ludovico begged us to turn for a moment to see the
crowd below, a restless sea of heads, an immense concourse
of people, but a good-natured crowd to which
any one might trust himself with safety. Many tourists,
English, French, and German as well as American,
went to St. Peter's to-day provided only with
the white <i>biglietti</i> of admission, and suffered no inconvenience.
I really hesitate to tell you just how many
souls are said to have been in the basilica this morning,
lest the apparent extravagance of my statement
should lead to incredulity in the future; but it is said
that there were over 50,000 souls inside the walls.
</p>

<p>
Dr. M. and Ludovico left us at the south door, and
once inside the building we had no difficulty in making
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137'>137</a></span>
our way to the sacristy, and through the gray marble
portal, by Romano's statues of St. Peter and St.
Paul, and so on to the tribunes in the transept.
</p>

<p>
Rich silk hangings draped the stone walls and columns,
those behind the papal throne being embroidered
in ecclesiastical designs. The throne was placed
in front of the ancient Chair of St. Peter, and between
our seats and the throne was the great high altar, ninety-five
feet in height, with its bronze canopy and graceful
spiral columns of Bernini, double spirals richly
gilded. As the mass was to be celebrated at the high
altar and as we were in the fourth row of seats from
the front, we were sure of a good view of the Pope.
All around us were the Swiss Guards, in the picturesque
costume of red, yellow, and black designed
by Michael Angelo, and the Pope's Guardia Nobile,
with "winged Achillean helmet above the Empire
uniform&mdash;half Greek, half French, half gods, half
dandies," as Mrs. Ward described this guard of young
nobles which surrounds the Pope. The uniform of
the Gendarme Pontificio is somewhat like that of the
old Philadelphia City Troop, a handsome uniform of
black and white with an immense shako adorned with
a red plume. But most gorgeous of all were the chamberlains,
in a costume of black velvet of the period of
Philip II., a Spanish dress with a velvet cape thrown
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138'>138</a></span>
over one shoulder, superb lace cuffs and collar and an
immense ruff around the neck, and gold cords and
chains without end. Zelphine and I fancied our
friend Dr. R., who was chamberlain to Pope Leo
XIII., figuring in this rich, decorative costume. One
of the chamberlains wore a costume of ruby-colored
velvet with a sable hood over his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
It was so interesting to sit still and watch the
changing scene before us that the two hours of waiting
passed quickly. The Pope's little sisters sat in front
of us in the seats nearest to the high altar, but
although quite close to us we could not see their faces.
They, of course, wore the costume <i>de rigueur</i> for such
functions, black gowns, and black lace veils on their
heads. During the long wait, an American girl sitting
near us told us of her experiences. Not understanding
about the costume required, "very stupidly,"
as she said and as we thought, she appeared
in a dark blue suit with a hat to match. The guard
refused to admit her, explaining the reason with signs
and gestures, pointing at the same time to the veiled
ladies passing through the doorway. Then, in a flash,
presto change!&mdash;our quick-witted countrywoman had
taken off her hat and tucked it in the folds of her
skirt, having previously denuded it of a black dotted
veil which she threw over her head. The guard, lost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139'>139</a></span>
in wonder at the sudden transformation, was so bedazzled
that he did not notice that her gown was blue
instead of black, or perhaps he was so sure that she
would get in by hook or by crook, that he allowed her
to pass, exclaiming, "Ah, these Americans!"
</p>

<p>
"Something is going to happen," said Angela;
"the Swiss Guards are coming." A detachment
marched along the central aisle, with cuirass and iron
helmet added to their brilliant plumage of every-day
wear, and lined up by the papal throne. There was a
rustle and stir of expectancy over the vast assemblage,
then breathless stillness like the silence of
nature before a storm. All eyes strained towards the
eastern door, through which entered the gorgeous
procession. The Palatine Guard lined the way down
the central aisle, some of the Swiss Guard being stationed
at different points. First came the Guardia
Nobile, then the mitred abbots, the bishops and archbishops
in copes and mitres of white and gold, the
patriarchs and cardinals, these latter with long capes
of cloth of gold worn over their scarlet robes. Then
came the canons and <i>monsignori</i> in lace and fur tippets,
after them the prince in attendance on the papal
throne, Don Filippo Orsini, followed by the secret
chamberlains bearing the precious tiaras and mitres
covered with gold and jewels. The triple crown,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140'>140</a></span>
which was borne upon a cushion, was a blaze of the
most brilliant jewels, diamonds, emeralds, and rubies,
too heavy in its richness to be borne long by any
mortal head.
</p>

<p>
Finally, announced by a blast from the silver trumpets,
the Pope appeared, seated in the <i>sedia gestatoria</i>,
borne above the heads of the multitude by members of
the household in a livery of scarlet cloth, the huge
feather fans or flabella being carried on each side.
I really did not grasp all these details at first, as the
interest all centred in that one august figure. The
Pope was pale, and at first appeared to be somewhat
agitated. It is said that he very much dislikes to be
carried into the church, and it must, indeed, be a trying
position. The chair is lifted high above the heads
of the people, that every one may see the Holy Father;
it is borne along slowly, pausing altogether at intervals.
There was a stop near our seats of a minute or
more, which gave us an opportunity to see the noble,
benevolent face of the one man who stands for so much
to millions of the faithful. Less handsome and distinguished
in appearance than some of his pictures,
Pius X. has that in his face that is worth infinitely
more than manly beauty or aristocratic bearing; one
cannot look into it without being impressed by his
earnestness and sincerity.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141'>141</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was all perfectly entrancing; the vast crowd of
people so still and reverent, and now and again, when
the interest was most intense, a subdued murmur, the
Pope turning to right and left to give his blessing,
just as he appears in the picture I send you. When
the Holy Father had been carried to the apse, he
descended from the <i>sedia gestatoria</i> and knelt in
prayer before St. Peter's Chair. At this moment a
bright ray of sunshine fell upon the group of prelates
in their rich and varied vestments; the jewels flashed
back their many-hued lights, making a gorgeous mass
of color, in the midst of which was the white-robed,
triple-crowned figure of the kneeling Pope.
</p>

<p>
In the service that followed we could hear the
Pope's voice distinctly when he intoned the Gloria,
and we were near enough to the altar to see him give
the cardinals the kiss of peace and celebrate the mass.
</p>

<p>
The Gregorian chants, which Pius X. so much
desires to restore to the services of the Catholic
Church, do not seem to be popular, especially among
musicians; but in this spacious basilica they sounded
grand and beautiful as they swelled forth and rose
and fell through its lofty arches. Suddenly from
Michael Angelo's great dome overhead there issued
the exultant strains of the silver trumpets, filling the
church with their sweet, penetrating music; the long
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142'>142</a></span>
line of soldiers from the Chair of St. Peter to the
eastern door bent the knee, lowering their arms upon
the stone pavement with a ringing sound, the mighty
congregation bowed or knelt, and we knew that the
supreme moment had come for the elevation of the
Host upon the high altar. Then there was a solemn
stillness, in which one could hear a pin drop, followed
by the stir of the rising of the vast audience, like
nothing that I can think of save the rustling of the
leaves of a forest swept over by an autumn storm.
</p>

<p>
There was a great deal of antiphonal singing in the
service, in which the Holy Father took part; his beautiful
voice rang through the church when he chanted
the liturgical prayers and the responses in the "Exultate
Justi" and the "Filii Jerusalem." The choruses
were glorious, about twelve hundred voices,
pupils from the seminaries and colleges and from the
Schola Cantorum taking part.
</p>

<p>
After the Pope had given the apostolic benediction
and granted plenary indulgence to the faithful, which
formula was read by the Cardinal Bishop in a loud
voice, he again ascended the gestatorial chair and was
borne from the church as he had entered it, slowly,
giving the blessing to right and left, amid a subdued
murmur, which he himself prevented from rising to
applause by placing his finger upon his lip in very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143'>143</a></span>
decided disapproval. He could not, however, prevent
the waving of handkerchiefs and other mute signs
of delight. The Holy Father looked much more cheerful
on his journey back to the Vatican, as if greatly
relieved that the ordeal was nearly over. All eyes
eagerly followed the receding figure until the canopied
chair passed out of sight behind the heavy damask
curtains of the Chapel of the Pietà.
</p>

<p>
There was stillness for a moment, and then the
voices, long silenced, broke forth in exclamations of
interest and pleasure and in salutations to friends.
All the English and Americans in Rome seemed to
be in St. Peter's to-day, and many distinguished Catholics
from different parts of the world. A number of
persons came forward to speak to the Pope's sisters,
who seemed to be holding quite a reception as we
passed by them on our way to the doors.
</p>

<p>
It was good to be in the open again, in the sparkling
air and under the shining sun, which is not too
hot, only genial and kindly in its warmth in these
early April days.
</p>

<p>
Angela was telling Ludovico how much she had
enjoyed the solemn yet brilliant spectacle, and asking
him rapid, eager questions about this official and that&mdash;questions
that Ludovico was only too glad to
answer, while he drew her to the other side of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144'>144</a></span>
piazza where a German grand duchess and two lesser
duchesses were stepping into their coaches. We also
had the honor of seeing the Earl and Countess of Denbigh
enter their carriage.
</p>

<p>
"It has all been perfectly delightful; I shall never
forget it!" exclaimed Angela, and then turning to me
with frankest inconsequence, she said, "Pray let us
do something quite different this afternoon!"
</p>

<p>
Ludovico fortunately did not hear her aside; but
Dr. M. did, and, with his ready sense of humor, was
vastly entertained, and will never cease to tease
Angela about the effect upon her mind of a solemn
service in the greatest cathedral in the world.

</p>

<p>
The "something quite different" that Zelphine
and I consented to do with Angela yesterday afternoon
was to go to the Villa Madama. The drive was
pleasant, and the villa itself is charmingly situated on
one of the precipitous sides of Monte Mario, but alas!
when we reached the entrance gate we found it barred
and bolted, which shows how important it is to consult
guide-books and local itineraries before making
these expeditions.
</p>

<p>
Rosalie, who was with us, spied a man in the
grounds, to whom our <i>vetturino</i> called, "Ecco, ecco!"&mdash;the
ejaculation which corresponds to our "hello,"
although it is more universal, as it seems to be suited
to all occasions, grave or gay. This man proved to
be the custodian of the villa. He stated emphatically
that the villa was closed and could not be exhibited
to-day; but when he caught the gleam of silver in
Angela's outstretched hand, he swung the gate open
hospitably.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146'>146</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This Medici villa, which was named after a daughter
of Charles V. who married Alessandro de' Medici,
is not spacious and imposing like the Villa d'Este or
the Borghese; but it is an ideal patrician country-seat.
We had been reading Marion Crawford's novel in
which he describes this villa, restored by the Contessina
Cecilia Palladio. So perfect is the <i>vraisemblance</i>
of the novelist's picture that when we entered
the half-ruinous, deserted house, from whose damp
walls the beautiful frescoes are fast fading, we felt a
shock of disappointment. Mr. Crawford's glowing
description is of the Villa Madama as it should be
rather than as it is.
</p>

<p>
If I were only a multi-millionaire, I would buy
this lovely old place and make it the thing of beauty
that Mr. Crawford describes. In fact, Rosalie and I
sat in the "court of honor" by the old fountain
basin, and planned a restoration which we thought
even superior to Cecilia Palladio's, with plate-glass
sashes in the loggias and steam heat to dry out the
dampness and preserve Giulio Romano's wonderful
frescoes; comfort as well as beauty would reign in
the old villa! When this great work is completed, we
four are to meet here every spring in the rose-time;
would you like to come, Allan, as our first guest to
this <i>château en Espagne</i>?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147'>147</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Angela, in whom the instincts for castle-building and
for home-making are sadly wanting, interrupted our
day-dreams by reminding us that we were due at a
tea, and had barely time to get to the Via Ludovisi by
five o'clock. As we passed by the barracks near the
Ponte Margherita, our driver motioned toward an
approaching carriage&mdash;a handsome carriage with liveries
and a fine span of horses but no outriders. In
the flash of the rapid passing we could only catch a
glimpse of two ladies inside; one with fine dark eyes,
animated and gracious, attracted us especially.
</p>

<p>
"The good Queen Mother," said the <i>vetturino</i>,
turning to us. "We all love her."
</p>

<p>
We were glad to have even this fleeting view of the
Queen so beloved by the Italians. It is charming to
hear them speak of her as they do, not as the Queen
Dowager, or the old Queen, but affectionately, as the
Queen Mother.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
Friday, April 15th.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Coxe, with whom we made the excursion to
Pæstum, called to see us yesterday morning. We
came near losing her visit altogether in this curious,
rambling pension, where the drawing-rooms are on
the third floor, the dining-room on the fourth, and the
bedrooms are scattered over all of the floors. The bell-boy
escorted our visitor, in truly foreign fashion, to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148'>148</a></span>
Zelphine's bedroom on the fourth <i>piano</i>, and as she
happened to be in the salon, and there was no boy or
bell in sight, Mrs. Coxe set forth on a voyage of discovery,
exploring the dining-room and then going
down to the smoking-rooms and library until she
found the salon, in which we were comfortably seated
enjoying our morning mail.
</p>

<p>
She laughed heartily over our detached way of living,
but said she was determined to find us even if
she followed us to the cellar, as she was the bearer of
an invitation to join a party to be conducted by Monsignor
A. through some of the rooms of the Vatican
not usually open to visitors. Mrs. Coxe had brought
a letter to this gentleman from her parish priest,
which was the reason for this courteous invitation in
which we were so generously included.
</p>

<p>
We met the Monsignor and his party near the steps
leading to the Sistine Chapel, and were taken through
the rooms in which the finest tapestries are kept&mdash;immense
pieces representing Scripture scenes. These
tapestries, which are beautiful, with all the delicacy
of painting and the richness of needlework, are only
used behind the altar when the Pope celebrates. Monsignor
A. told us that the Holy Father never celebrates
before a painting, always before tapestry. In
another room we saw a man at work upon a large
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149'>149</a></span>
altar-piece, weaving in the colors by hand&mdash;a slow
process, as you may imagine, but they count years
here as we count days.
</p>

<p>
We were allowed to enter the grand banquet-hall
hung with tapestries, in which preparations were
being made for a great dinner; handsome glass and
plate were on the buffet, looking very secular for <i>il
Vaticano</i>. We saw the rooms of one of the old popes,
and Monsignor A. showed us the low, broad steps
over which the popes used to ride on their white
mules from one part of the Vatican to the other. We
did not wonder that they were glad to ride through
this vast building, as we were tired after we had seen
only a small part of it and a few of the eleven thousand
rooms. Fancy the extent of this palace, with
its museums, libraries, chapels, and suites of apartments,
of which we gained some idea from the inner
court and galleries.
</p>

<p>
Monsignor A. proved to be a genial old gentleman
who enlivened his discourse with occasional anecdotes,
which, delicious as they were in his broken English,
would lose something of their flavor if I should undertake
to repeat them in less picturesque language. He
took us out on the balcony overlooking the piazza,
from which the Pope used to give his blessing to the
populace on Easter Sunday. The Monsignor said,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150'>150</a></span>
with some sadness, that this custom belonged to the
old régime. We could imagine what the great piazza
must have been, filled with devout kneeling figures,
and, like the good father, we regretted the passing of
this impressive ceremony.
</p>

<p>
As we were going through one of the large audience-halls,
an American lady drew Mrs. Coxe and
me aside.
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do about tipping?" she whispered.
"These men," pointing to some attendants,
"have been opening doors for us ever since we
started. We must fee them, and yet how can we do
it without attracting the attention of the Monsignor?
Do you think there will be an opportunity to give them
something?"
</p>

<p>
"If there is not," said Mrs. Coxe, promptly, "it
will be the first time such a thing ever happened in
Italy! I, for one, am quite willing to take my
chances on it."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later the Monsignor signified that we
had completed our tour with him. He courteously
hoped that we had been repaid for the fatigue of the
many steps we had taken. Then, motioning toward
the attendants, he said that we might give them a few
soldi for their trouble, adding, simply and naturally,
as if the words cost him no effort:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151'>151</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"The keys of the rooms that you have seen are in
the charge of a gentleman who lends them to me.
When I return them, I should be glad to hand him
something to repay him for his kindness. If you feel
like giving him a trifle, he and his friends will sit
down at a table in some garden, with a bottle of wine
before them, and drink to Father A.'s hat." His
own hat, of course! Was it not deliciously frank and
foreign? Mrs. Coxe glanced triumphantly at us, and
Angela was so much amused at the idea of contributing
to the convivial pleasures of several unknown gentlemen
in return for our privileges at the Vatican that
I thought it wise to make our compliments and adieus
to the Monsignor as quickly as possible, before she
should disgrace the party by unseemly hilarity.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
Thursday, April 21st.
</p>

<p>
This has been a full week, in which there has been
little time for letter-writing. Zelphine and I have
been driving about making calls and leaving cards
upon people who have invited us to their days. Angela
flatly refuses to join us, declaring that she did not
come to Rome to do the self-same things that she has
to do at home. Instead of which, she has been having
a gay time with the W.'s from Philadelphia, driving
to the "Doria-Pamfili" and going to the races at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152'>152</a></span>
Campanelle, for this is the height of the racing season.
To-day she went to the Grand Steeplechase of Rome,
and had the pleasure of seeing the King and Queen
driving in an open carriage drawn by four horses.
The Queen gave her own prize, the Queen Elena prize
offered to gentlemen riders, and who of all people
should get it but the young Roman who nearly ran
over Mrs. Robins at the meet! He is a titled personage,
the Marquis de B., but as we could not remember
his long, unpronounceable name, we have dubbed him
the Marquis de Carabas, being more familiar with
titles in fairy lore than in real life. Angela says that
when Ludovico brought the Marquis de B. to the carriage
to speak to her, she was in such terror lest she
should call him by our nickname that she was afraid
to open her mouth. Fancy Angela afraid to open her
mouth under any circumstances! She must have overcome
her hesitation, for she afterwards had a long talk
with the young Marquis, who took her and Mrs. W.
to have tea.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine and I find that our social duties have their
compensations, as we meet such interesting people. I
had a long talk with your friend Dr. White at a reception
the other evening. He told me that he was publishing
his reminiscences of diplomatic life in Russia
and Germany. Madame Waddington is here now, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153'>153</a></span>
much fêted of course. Mrs. Coxe, who has known her
for years, says that she is the same Mary King whom
she knew as a school-girl, and is quite as unspoiled
by the success of her book as by her diplomatic successes.
</p>

<p>
One day this week an American friend, who lives
here in a beautiful old palace, sent us her box for "Les
Huguenots." The box was in the centre of what we
call the balcony, near the royal box. We were hoping
that the King and Queen would appear, but we have
learned since that they seldom go to any plays except
those given in their own royal theatre. Otherwise the
house was as brilliant as we had expected, and the
singing very fine, the choruses unusually strong.
</p>

<p>
Ludovico brought the Marquis de B. to our box.
He has charming manners; indeed, so much manner
that one does not get beyond it. I prefer our American
heartiness to this studied politeness. Ludovico
has asked permission to bring the young Marquis to
call on us, assuring us that he belongs to one of the
oldest families in Italy. I told him that as a gentleman
and his friend the Marquis de B. would be welcome
without the glory of an ancient lineage. Ludovico
laughed, and said, "Oh, you Americans are so
proud&mdash;as proud of your democracy as if you were
all nobles!"

President Loubet is coming to Rome next Sunday,
and the whole city has begun to put on yards of bunting
to receive him. These people possess a genius for
decoration, and have a clever fashion of hanging
bright-colored shawls and bits of carpet out of their
windows; the effect is really very good.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
Sunday, April 24th.
</p>

<p>
Rome is <i>en fête</i> to-day, a brilliantly gay city! We
were invited to see the reception of M. Loubet from a
balcony overlooking the Esedra di Termine, from
which we had a fine view of the great concourse of
people&mdash;a wonderful sight! All the school-children
of Rome were seated on stands surrounding the
piazza; there were lines and lines of soldiers, cavalry
and infantry, and people were standing everywhere
except in the space reserved for the carriages; those of
the nobility were like gilded Cinderella coaches, their
coachmen and footmen in gorgeous livery. The carriage
of the Mayor, Prince Prosper Colonna, was
especially fine.
</p>

<p>
The band played the Marcia Reale, a curious little
quickstep air, which announced the approach of the
expected guest. A troop of cuirassiers opened the
way; then came the royal carriage with the red liveries
of the house of Savoy, the King and President Loubet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155'>155</a></span>
seated side by side. Prince Colonna received the distinguished
guest with much grace and dignity; the
band then struck up the Marseillaise; the applause
was wild, vivas, bravos on all sides. These Italians
are not, I fancy, devotedly attached to the French
Republic or to its President; but like all Latin peoples
they delight in a celebration, a general hurrah, martial
music, flying banners, and tumultuous applause.

We have quaffed our last draught from the Fountain
of Trevi, thrown a penny into the pool to ensure
our return to Rome, and taken a farewell look at Neptune
and his floundering steeds. Our trunks are
packed, as we had planned to leave Rome this morning,
but the men did not come for our boxes, which are
to go by <i>petite vitesse</i> to Florence while we loiter by
the way in several hill towns. We set forth to discover
the reason of the delay, and found the express
office closed, all business being suspended during the
grand review which is being held on the Piazza d'Armi
in honor of the French President. It is evident
that we shall have to adapt our movements to those
of this worthy gentleman; but after all, this detention
cannot be looked upon as an unmixed evil, as it gave
us a few hours more in Rome which we spent in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156'>156</a></span>
Vatican. After taking a last lingering look at the
Apollo and the Laocoon, we had an hour in the Sistine
Chapel for the ceiling frescoes of Michael Angelo.
To-day being brilliantly clear, the faces and figures
stood out as we had never seen them before, and we
ended by feeling grateful to M. Loubet, for had he not
detained us we might never have so truly appreciated
the magnificent Prophets and Sybils, which are difficult
to see properly in cloudy weather such as we had
during Holy Week.

<p>
Ludovico and the Marquis de B. were at the station
this afternoon to see us off, although they had spent
a part of the morning with us. They both brought
offerings of flowers, which was certainly a graceful
attention on the part of the Marquis, whom we only
know casually; but here they offer flowers with almost
as little thought as one says good morning in America.
Zelphine and I have the dark red ones that we love;
Angela's are white and pink. The Marquis paid our
youngest and fairest some compliments about the roses
matching the color in her cheeks, which served to
spread a pink glow all over her face and to make
Ludovico angry. It is quite evident that we are not
leaving Rome too soon, as these good friends might
quarrel if we should stay longer, and my duties as a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157'>157</a></span>
chaperon would certainly become more arduous. We
shall miss Ludovico at every turn, and I flatter myself
that he will miss us. We have all so enjoyed our
Roman days together, and he and Angela were simply
<i>bons camarades</i>, after the comfortable, unsentimental
fashion of the modern boy and girl, until the Marquis
came into our little circle with his too evident admiration
and florid, Continental compliments.

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Orvieto</span>, April 27th.
</p>

<p>
We have been travelling so fast, in the last days,
that there has been no time for writing, which is my
excuse for not sending you a letter from Viterbo,
whose middle-age charms might fill many pages. Now
I am writing with the brilliant colors of the façade
of Orvieto's great cathedral still dazzling my eyes.
We saw it first at sunset, when its exquisite colors
were intensified, and glowed in harmony with the
delicate rose and rich golden glory of the sky. With
its vast mosaic front and exquisite Gothic arches and
spires, the Cathedral of Orvieto is the central point
of shining light in the old gray-brown town which it
crowns. This evening it was like a jewel with a
thousand facets gleaming in the sunset light, and, as
many travellers have asserted, its immense rose-window
above the cathedral portal is in itself worth a
journey to Orvieto. This window with the lovely
mosaic above it of Christ and the Virgin Mary
enthroned and surrounded by angels, all in the softest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159'>159</a></span>
blue, crimson, and gold, quite enthralled us, and we
lingered so long before the cathedral that the sunset
colors faded, the delicate hues of the mosaic grew
dim, and darkness fell upon the huge mass, wrapping
it about as with a garment. "We shall never again
see anything so beautiful in this world," said Zelphine,
solemnly, as we walked back to our hotel
through the narrow, dark streets. And indeed I doubt
if we ever shall; to behold a sunset of such brilliancy
illuminating a building of beauty so entrancing is
something that one need not expect to have repeated
in a lifetime.
</p>

<p>
We intended to come here directly from Rome, a
journey of only a few hours; a detour to Montefiascone
and Viterbo was decided upon, on the spur of
the moment, just before leaving Rome. Zelphine came
across some notes about Montefiascone in her Baedeker
that reminded her of Mr. Longfellow's description
of his visit to the tomb of Johannes Fugger of
Augsburg, upon which she insisted that we linger a
day and night on our journey hither, in order to visit
the sacred city of the Etruscans.
</p>

<p>
You probably recall the story in "Outre-Mer," and
will be laughing at us for going many miles to do
honor to the memory of a wine-loving old bishop; but
I was glad that we had listened to Zelphine's words of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160'>160</a></span>
wisdom, as the place itself, quite aside from the strange
tomb, is so interesting&mdash;a little gray town towering
above the green plain, with narrow streets and high
stone houses, plastered, to be sure, but still ancient and
impressive. Just outside the gate is a small inn, the
Aquila Nera, which is said to occupy the site of the
shrine of Voltumna, the tutelary goddess of the Etruscans,
where the princes of the nation once gathered
in council. Here we discharged our <i>vetturino</i>, as this
hill town is not adapted to the luxuries of modern
transportation, and made our way on foot to the
Church of San Flaviano.
</p>

<p>
We did not, like Mr. Longfellow, make a midnight
pilgrimage to Bishop Fugger's tomb; our visit was at
high noon. The eleventh-century Church of San Flaviano
is unique and imposing, with its huge Romanesque
columns, Gothic doorways, and upper and lower
buildings. Here before the high altar is a well-worn
gravestone with a relief of a bishop in his robes, a
goblet on each side of his head, and at his feet the
cabalistic words "Est, Est, Est." The remainder of
the inscription we could not decipher, but we afterwards
learned that it ran thus:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span lang="la">"EST. EST. EST. PR(OPTER) NIM(IUM)&mdash;EST. HIC
IO(ANNES) DE VC DO(MINUS)&mdash;MEUS MORTUUS EST."</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161'>161</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The strange inscription and the two goblets confirmed
the story of the convivial bishop, who, in order
to secure good wine at each inn, while travelling
through Etruria, sent his servant a day's journey in
advance of him, instructing him to write "Est" in
some agreed place if he found the wine good. When
the taster came to Montefiascone, he was so charmed
with the native wine that he wrote "Est, Est, Est,"
on the wall. Bishop Fugger arrived in due time,
thoroughly endorsed the opinion of his servant, and
drank of the "Est" wine so freely that in a short
time he himself was <i>non est</i>. With his last breath the
bishop dictated a will, by which he bequeathed a considerable
sum of money to the town upon condition
that a cask of the "Est" wine be annually poured
over his grave. This, they tell us, was actually done
until within a few years, when the wine became too
precious to be poured forth in libations so generous.
Now you will surely come to Montefiascone&mdash;"mountain
of the flask," as everything has a vinous association
here&mdash;and drink to the peace of his soul who
drank "not wisely but too well."
</p>

<p>
From San Flaviano we strolled back to the Aquila
Nera, where, if the bread was of the color and consistency
of leather, the eggs were fresh and the fried
artichokes delicious, while the wine&mdash;well, the wine,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162'>162</a></span>
like dear Charles Lamb's sublimated roast pig and
many other delectable things, must be tasted to be
understood. No words of mine can convey to you
any idea of its sweetness and fragrance and general
deliciousness, cooled as it is with snow from the surrounding
mountains, after the fashion of the ancient
Romans. After tasting of the "Est, Est, Est," we
were more ready to shed a tear over the tomb of the
bishop than we had been before luncheon, and we can
also better understand how the peasants of this region
live on their poor fare when it is accompanied by
nectar of the gods&mdash;a wine which does not seem to
intoxicate, as they drink it, but is an article of diet
like coffee or tea or cocoa or oil. Another characteristic
of the "Est, Est, Est," is that it must be drunk
here, as it will not bear transportation even to Rome.
</p>

<p>
After luncheon we climbed up the steep street which
leads to the cathedral. This great building, with its
gigantic dome, richly colored marbles, and its many
statues and frescoes, in a little out-of-the-way town
whose history is all over and done with, affords one of
the striking contrasts that add so much to the charm of
Italy. A brilliant gem in a dull setting is this old
church, and yet with its many points of light the jewel
irradiates the sombre setting, instead of making it
seem darker by contrast. We left the beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163'>163</a></span>
cathedral reluctantly to take an afternoon train to
Viterbo, where we were told that we should find a
much more comfortable inn than at Montefiascone.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine, living over again the glorious past of the
great Etruscan city which we were about to visit,
scorned all thought of creature comfort, yet Angela
and I noticed that she seemed to enjoy the unexpected
luxuries of the really good hotel in Viterbo as much
as we more mundane beings. Angela was in her element
in a brilliantly lighted hotel, with a large, bright
dining-room and well-appointed tables, and began at
once to wish that we had better gowns in which to
grace the festive scene than the light silk waists
which we had brought with us to wear with our travelling-skirts.
And yet, this very morning, we had all
been congratulating ourselves upon our small amount
of luggage, declaring that we were only free women
when we had sent our trunks in advance of us and
could hold our worldly goods in our two hands. Zelphine
and I still rejoice in our freedom; but we are
not Angelas, with youth and all its possibilities.
</p>

<p>
Viterbo is the oldest-looking place that we have
seen except Pompeii. In the most ancient portions of
the city, in the little dark streets with their high walls,
tunnels, and archways, one may go back a thousand
years to the ninth and tenth centuries. Here are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164'>164</a></span>
many towers for defence, and massive fortified dwellings
with richly carved porticos, balustrades, and balconies;
and in keeping with the antique architecture
are the peasants, in their wide-brimmed hats and
sheepskin breeches with the hair outside, still wearing
their cloaks like the ancient Romans, one end thrown
over the left shoulder. The storm-cloaks of the peasants
of this region are heirlooms, descending from
father to son, often more than a hundred years old.
The walls of Viterbo are almost as perfect as in the
twelfth century, when, like Troy of old, it stood a long
siege for the sake of a woman's beauty and charm.
Galiana, for whose possession two powerful families
of Rome and Viterbo waged war, must have been a
far nobler creature than the lady of Trojan fame.
When the Romans outside the walls promised to end
the war if Galiana would but grant them a sight of her
fair face upon the town walls, she promptly yielded
to the request, and appeared upon a tower which still
bears her name. Here Galiana fell, pierced by the
arrow of a treacherous Roman. We saw the tomb and
an inscription to the heroic Galiana on the façade of
the Church of St. Angelo, which stands on the Piazza
del Plebiscito.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if women are beautiful enough nowadays
to lead men to war for their sakes," said Angela.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165'>165</a></span>
As she stood there, her perfect outline silhouetted
against the gray background of Galiana's old tower,
the slanting sunbeams lighting up her fair hair, I wondered
whether Helen of Troy or Galiana of Viterbo
had either of them been more beautiful than our
American Angela. Then, suddenly recalling the little
scene at the railroad station in Rome, I answered so
emphatically, "I hope not," that Zelphine started,
and came back from the past long enough to look at
me questioningly.
</p>

<p>
"How seriously you take it all, Margaret," said
Angela, with her light laugh. "Even if we are not
as beautiful as those old-time ladies, we are certainly
much happier, travelling about to please ourselves, as
we are doing, instead of being carried off to some
castle to please somebody else, and then having a long
war about it all. I do wonder, though, that some great
poem has not been written about Galiana on her
tower."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt Italian poets have written about her
again and again," said Zelphine.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, of course, but I mean in some language
that people can understand. Mr. Browning, for
instance, could have written a great poem about Galiana."
</p>

<p>
I doubt if Mr. Browning ever found his way here;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166'>166</a></span>
few English-speaking people came to Viterbo before
the railroad from Rome was built. But was not
Angela's explanation sufficiently original to please
you or Zelphine or any other ardent admirer of Mr.
Browning?
</p>

<p>
Zelphine was delighted, and said, as she linked her
arm in mine to descend the narrow, steep street that
leads towards the hotel, that under her tutelage and
mine Angela was really beginning to develop some
sentiment. Angela's sentiment did not impress me as
much as her linguistic perspective, which made me
think of the Scotchwoman who said that the Lord
would not listen to the prayers of the French, because
they were "sic jabberin budies."&mdash;You remember
the story; was it before the battle of Agincourt?
How one forgets English history, here in towns that
so long antedate the Norman conquest!
</p>

<p>
This morning we drove to Bagnaja, only a short distance
north-east of Viterbo and built upon one of the
slopes of the Ciminian Hills. From an eminence
near Bagnaja we had a noble view of Montefiascone
ten miles away, a little, gray town dominated by the
dome of the vast cathedral, while much nearer lay
Viterbo, with its lofty campanile and one hundred
towers, dark, formidable, and majestic. We stopped
at Bagnaja to see the great mediæval castle, with its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167'>167</a></span>
huge machicolated tower; and then driving to the
south of the main piazza over a fine macadamized
road, if one may venture to use a term so modern in
describing this land of the ancients, we were soon
face to face with one of the most beautiful of the
Italian villas, that of the Duca di Lante. We were
admitted to fairyland by a very conventional method,
the presentation of visiting-cards, and were then conducted
by a most obsequious servant, evidently with
generous expectations, who unlocked gates that led to
the more secluded precincts of this garden of delight.
Rest and refreshment for body and spirit we found in
the loveliness and harmony of our surroundings.
Surely the queen of the fairies, Titania herself, must
have presided over the laying out of these grounds.
Zelphine and I ignored the lore of guides and guide-books,
not caring to learn that any mortal man had
had a hand in producing such beauty as this. The
great basin in front of the house, with its central
fountain bordered by blooming plants, glittered in
the sunshine. Beyond were the terraces, with their
tiers of fairy cascades and fountains, where ilexes as
large as those in the Borghese Gardens cast a shade so
deep that nymphs and sprites might dance under
them, as freely as in Corot's pictures, unseen by loiterers
on the adjacent parterres.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168'>168</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Sitting under the shade of a huge ilex, while a bird
sang to us from its sheltering branches, we all breathed
a deep sigh of content, and congratulated ourselves,
in Jeffersonian phrase, upon life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness, after our own vagrant fashion. We
might suffer from cold and even from hunger in some
wretched inn to-night, but to-day we drank from a
full cup of delight; the largess of the gods was ours,
in a wealth of Italian sunshine and an air as intoxicating
as the muscatel wine for which this region is
famous. For the moment we possessed all the glories
of the dead and gone Dukes of Lante, with neither
their sorrows nor their crimes to deepen the shadows
upon those gay parterres and sparkling fountains.
</p>

<p>
"It matters little whether or not we lunch to-day,"
said Zelphine, "for we
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i10">
                  "'on honey-dew have fed,
</p>
<p class="i1">
And drunk the milk of Paradise.'"
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
"Speak for yourself, Zelphine," said Angela.
"Honey-dew and the milk of Paradise may satisfy
your delicate appetite, but mine needs something more
substantial to feed upon. A good slice of American
roast beef would be more to my taste."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Angela!" exclaimed Zelphine. "And in
such a spot as this!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169'>169</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Evidently Angela's sentiment was not developing
as rapidly as Zelphine could wish.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," continued our practical youngest, "I
would not turn away from a slice of roast beef and a
baked potato, even in this enchanting spot. I really
am almost hungry enough this moment to share with
our driver the crust of leathery bread that he is probably
enjoying while he waits for us."
</p>

<p>
"Poor child," said Zelphine, compassionately, delving
into "Mrs. Lecks," from which convenient receptacle
she produced a cake of chocolate.
</p>

<p>
"Zelphine, you certainly are a dear, and have a
human heart," said Angela, as she contentedly
munched the chocolate, "even if you are as romantic
as&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As her own great-grandmother's portrait by
Stuart," said I, helping out Angela, who is not strong
in the line of similes, "a beautiful lady, chiefly composed
of fine eyes and hair, with a marvellous complexion
and no anatomy to speak of."
</p>

<p>
Laughing and talking we sauntered on toward the
entrance gate, near which we found our <i>vetturino</i>.
As Angela had predicted, he was eating his dry crust,
flavored, we were glad to notice, by a crisp bit of
fennel, which they use here as we do celery.
</p>

<p>
When we returned to Viterbo, it looked like a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170'>170</a></span>
deserted village; the picturesque peasants in their
sheepskin suits were nowhere to be seen on the
streets, and shops and windows were closed. It
appeared as if some public calamity had befallen the
beautiful old city. We afterwards learned that the
inhabitants of Viterbo, adhering to a time-honored
custom, retire for a siesta at mid-day, from which
they emerge at three or four in the afternoon to spend
the evening gaily on the Corso, thronging the shops,
which are brilliantly lighted. Fortunately for us, the
employees of the hotel do not demand a mid-day rest,
and a luncheon was served us sufficiently substantial
to satisfy appetites sharpened by a long morning in
this bracing mountain air.
</p>

<p>
Here at Orvieto we are lodged in a modern hotel,
something of a surprise in this ancient, isolated city,
which is built upon a rock, like the habitation of the
wise man of the Scriptures. This morning we spent
some time in the Necropolis, which is under the precipitous
cliffs of red tufa that seem to buttress this
old town. In the Campo Santo, which is all that is left
of the Etruscan city of Orvieto, we found avenues
lined with tomb chambers. The streets are like those
of a city, except that the houses are without windows,
and no eager eyes look forth from the doors that open
upon the silent street. Within is a square chamber containing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171'>171</a></span>
stone couches at its sides for the repose of the
dead, all of the other furniture of an Etruscan tomb,
vases, bronzes, terra-cotta portrait busts and statues,
having been carried off for the enrichment of various
museums. From the Necropolis we made our way to
the famous Well of San Patrizio, with its curious corkscrew
stairway leading down into the huge basin
below.
</p>

<p>
We would gladly spend another day in Orvieto, in
order to view the cathedral's matchless façade once
more by morning light, and at noon, and again at
sunset, and so allow its beauty to print itself upon
our minds, and also to study the Signorelli frescoes
in the interior, the Fate of the Wicked and the Saints
in Heaven, which, with their muscular devils and
saints, are strangely suggestive of Michael Angelo.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you not stop another day?" I hear you
ask. Because if we tarry here longer, we shall be
obliged to cut off a day in Perugia or Assisi or some
ancient city quite as interesting as Orvieto, and Katharine
Clarke is writing to us urging us to get to Florence
early in May, if we wish to see the City of
Flowers in the exquisite freshness of its spring beauty.
The roses on the hillside garden near San Miniato are
budding and blowing, and she tells us that we must
be there soon if we would see them in their prime. No
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172'>172</a></span>
matter how charming a spot we may be in, there is
always some other delightful place beckoning us on
and on!
</p>

<p>
We quite agree with the traveller, whose name I
forget, but whose advice is, "Whatever towns you
neglect between Rome and Florence, do not fail to
see Orvieto." And yet we are filled with regret
because we must pass by so many of the interesting
towns of this region, Terni with its rushing waters,
"rapid as the light," Bolsena on its lovely lake, and
Orte. Of this latter town we saw little from the window
of the railway carriage, except a line of hungry
tourists struggling to reach the buffet during the short
stop at the station, a scene so suggestive of our own
land of rapid transit and hurried luncheons that, for
a moment, we almost felt that we were travelling in
America.

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Perugia</span>, April 28th.
</p>

<p>
The journey from Orvieto to Perugia is a short one,
and we had our first sight of this fine old town in the
brilliancy of a spring afternoon. We were fortunate
in finding a cab at the station, and a <i>vetturino</i> who
welcomed us to his coach with great cordiality, we
being the only arrivals by the afternoon train. Having
with many ejaculations disposed of us and our
various pieces of hand-luggage, large and small, he
hospitably invited a comely peasant woman to a seat
by his side. Her luxuriant black hair was fashionably
dressed and guiltless of hat or kerchief; her black
dress was coarse but tidy, while a pair of kid gloves,
which had evidently seen service, gave a touch of elegance
to the simple costume. A large kerchief, which
is the favorite shopping receptacle, marketing bag,
and portmanteau of the Italian peasant&mdash;this one as
full as the proverbial horn of plenty&mdash;occupied one
gloved hand, while with the other she gesticulated and
accentuated her animated conversation, to the evident
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174'>174</a></span>
interest and amusement of her host. With their heads
close together, deep in conversation, one talking, the
other listening and occasionally interjecting a comment,
we wondered whether the pair were lovers or
only <i>bons camarades</i> discussing the last bit of home
news or village gossip, for village gossip is said to
flourish under the shadow of the shrine of St. Francis,
just as here the cheerful and apparently honest <i>vetturino</i>
will cheat you out of a franc as cleverly as a
cabby of Naples or any other Sodom of the plain.
</p>

<p>
A cheerful town Perugia seemed to us, as we drove
up the long hill and saw the old fortress, with its
weed-grown ramparts and many towers, basking in
the April sunshine. Like all of these hill towns
Perugia is gray, and yet with a difference: a dash
of chrome in its stones gives a warmer tone to the old
palaces and walls, which seem to be all of a piece
with the rock from which they were hewn. This rock
forms the foundation, and was once the strength, of
this "empress of hillside Italian cities."
</p>

<p>
We had no hotel addresses for Perugia except the
Brufani, and, as we often find it more enlightening to
our minds as well as more advantageous to our purses
to stop in small hotels or pensions, we asked the driver
if he knew of a good stopping-place. He seemed to
understand, shook his head as if in deep thought, then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175'>175</a></span>
consulted his companion; upon which they both looked
us all over as if taking our measure, and, evidently
being agreed as to our status, he exclaimed, reassuringly,
"<i>Ecco, ecco</i>, we know the <i>albergo</i> that will suit
the <i>società</i>!" Whipping his horse as we drew near
the Porta Nuova, he rattled through the gate, across
the wide piazza, and down a long hill, to a house on a
narrow street, where we are comfortably lodged.
</p>

<p>
This pleasant little pension is kept by an English
lady, with whom we have already established relations,
as some of our friends stopped here last year, and we
are all now basking in the genial atmosphere of good
will created by them.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
April 29th.
</p>

<p>
This morning we found our way to the little Piazza
delle Prome, on the verge of the cliff, below which is
a sheer fall of one hundred feet to the ancient city
wall of the Etruscans. Below us, as we stood in the
garden of the Prefettura, were the remains of Etruscan
buildings, above them massive blocks laid by the
Romans, and spread before us was the wide valley bordered
by near and distant mountains. This marvellous
view from the Prefettura is second to none that
we have seen, always excepting the vast sweep of the
green and fertile plain at Grenada as we saw it from
the heights of the Alhambra.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176'>176</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We afterwards wandered from street to street,
across piazzas and under arches, until we found ourselves
in the Via Vecchia. Well named indeed is this
ancient street, for the Via Vecchia has been trodden
by the foot of man for three thousand years! This
street, with its high buildings of heavy Roman workmanship,
more like fortresses than dwelling-houses,
leads to the great Arch of Augustus. The arch, constructed
of solid blocks of travertine and sustained by
huge buttresses, is adorned by a graceful pavilion
and loggia, a noble monument to the Roman Emperor
who rebuilt Perugia and inscribed upon its gateway
"Augusta Perusia."
</p>

<p>
After we had revelled for a couple of hours in the
delight of strolling about in the open, we retraced
our steps to the Via Vanucci, and entered the Collegio
del Cambio, in whose audience-chamber are many
Perugino frescoes, all lovely save a horribly realistic
Beheading of John the Baptist, from which we were
glad to turn to a Nativity and a Transfiguration and
to the noble Sibyls and Prophets. The head of Daniel
is said to be a portrait of Perugino's greater pupil,
Raphael. Even if Perugino was lacking in breadth
and sometimes in grace, there is a depth and delicacy
of color in his work and so much sweetness and tenderness
in the faces of the women and children that,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177'>177</a></span>
as we stood before these charming groups, we could
well believe that this Umbrian artist was, as his chronicler
said, "possessed of a stainless purity of soul,"
and that Raphael owed much to his early master.
</p>

<p>
Perugino was named after the town, not of his
birth, but of his fame; <i>mais, de grace</i>, monsieur, I do
not intend to give you a disquisition upon the Umbrian
school of painting, of which there are many notable
examples in the churches here and in the Pinacoteca.
This last, let me explain, is the name, unpronounceable
by English-speaking people, which is given to the
picture-galleries in some of these old towns. There
are really treasures of art in Perugia, with whose
beauties I might fill many letters, interesting paintings
by Manni, by Bonfigli, the great forerunner of
Perugino, by Pinturicchio, his associate, and by many
of his pupils; and in the Sala del Fra Angelico are
some of the exquisite works of the idealist whose name
it bears.
</p>

<p>
The Pinacoteca Vanucci is on the third floor of the
Palazzo del Municipio. The doorway of this palace,
with its mediæval lions and griffins&mdash;the emblem of
Perugia&mdash;in exquisite Gothic carving all dominated
by three saints, presents a much more harmonious
whole than this confused grouping would lead one
to suppose.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178'>178</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This afternoon we drove to Lake Thrasymene, passing
the tower of San Manno, with its Etruscan inscription,
and castles and battle-grounds of long ago,
until we reached that most ancient one on the shores
of the beautiful lake where Hannibal and Flaminius
fought until the little stream ran red with blood, and
so ever after has been named "Sanguinetto." A
grewsome association this, with a fair stream of running
water, and yet how much more euphonious, especially
with the soft Italian lingering over syllables,
than our American equivalent "Bloody Run!"
</p>

<p class="ralign">
April 30th.
</p>

<p>
We wandered joyously through the streets and
squares of the old town this morning, for here one
does not set forth to walk to a given point&mdash;one simply
wanders at will. We generally cross the Piazza
Vittorio Emanuele, with its heroic statue of Italy's
soldier king, stroll along the Corso Vanucci, the main
street of the town, and then go down steps, many steps,
which descend into narrow winding streets and <i>viali</i>
with most alluring names, as Via Curiosa, Via Deliziosa,
Via Bontempi, and the like. Angela says that the
last sounds delightfully convivial and suggests no
end of a good time; but it probably means nothing
less prosaic than good weather.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179'>179</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After winding in and out of narrow streets and up
and down steps, all exquisitely picturesque if somewhat
fatiguing, we came out on the Piazza del Municipio
and before a beautiful thirteenth-century fountain
with three basins, which are richly decorated
with scriptural and mythological figures. The many
slender columns which support these basins give to
the whole a charming lightness and grace. This lovely
fountain of Fra Bevignate was without water for
centuries until, in 1899, the new aqueduct, which
comes directly from the springs of Nocera, was opened,
whereupon it played gayly in the sunshine, as it does
to-day. The Nocera water, for which, bottled, we
paid a considerable price in Rome, is free as air on
this favored hill-top.
</p>

<p>
Facing the fountain is the Cathedral of San
Lorenzo. To the left of the doorway is a bronze statue
of Pope Julian III., who restored some ancient privileges
to the Perugians, and on the right is a handsome
Gothic pulpit from which St. Bernardino once
preached to the faithful in the square. Inside the
cathedral we saw the beautiful tomb of Bishop Baglioni,
a fine Deposition by Baroccio, and a miraculous
picture of the Madonna delle Grazie by Manni.
</p>

<p>
San Lorenzo claims the distinction of being the
burial-place of three popes, Innocent III., Urban IV.,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180'>180</a></span>
and Martin IV. Here, too, is the betrothal ring of
the Virgin. This precious relic is preserved in a silver
casket guarded by fifteen locks, the keys of which
are entrusted to fifteen persons of distinction, and is
only to be seen five times during the year. The mystery
and exclusiveness with which this relic is guarded
whetted Zelphine's curiosity, and she insisted that it
was in a certain sense our right to see the precious
ring, having been shown the hair of the Blessed Virgin
in Rome. Angela said that as American travellers we
had a right to see anything and everything, but, as
the next date for the exhibition of the ring was the
second Sunday in July, the real question at issue was,
were we willing to stay in Perugia so long, and, even
if the Perugians were disposed to make an earlier
date for us, was it likely that the fifteen persons of
distinction with their fifteen keys could be collected
on short notice? From my own observations, I was
inclined to doubt the existence of fifteen Perugians of
distinction at any date. However, distinction is a
descriptive quite as subject to variations as the clear
or cloudy day of the scientific gentleman who arranges
our weather for us in America, and some of the men
whom we passed on the piazza this morning may be
lineal descendants of the ancient lords of Perugia, and
now in possession of the important keys.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181'>181</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The celebrated Sposalizio of Perugino&mdash;a unique
conception of the Virgin's espousal&mdash;which should be
here with the betrothal ring, has unfortunately been
carried off to France; but there are still many more
treasures in painting and sculpture in San Lorenzo
than we could appreciate in one morning, among the
latter a statue of Leo XIII., who was Archbishop of
Perugia. Over across the piazza is the Episcopal
Palace, where this Prince of the Church lived for
many years, preparing himself by study and reflection
for the great future in store for him. We passed
from the church into the cloisters, which are ruinous,
but charming, as are all the ruins here, with their bits
of lovely sculpture and flowers growing in the
"crannied walls" and on the little balconies above our
heads.
</p>

<p>
Retracing our steps along the Via Bontempi, and
losing ourselves several times, after the fashion of
travellers who will not consent to have their pleasure
interfered with by guides, we reached the quaint
covered Via della Stalla and suddenly emerged upon
a gay scene&mdash;the Piazza Garibaldi on a market-day.
Here were flowers and fruits heaped upon wagons,
and booths gay with colored prints, gorgeous kerchiefs,
and endless lines of small stockings of all colors,
which the Perugians doubtless buy even if the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182'>182</a></span>
feet of their children are as guiltless of covering as
those of the Venus and Adonis. The stockings are
probably for Sundays and high holidays. Here above
all were the peasants from the surrounding country,
not wearing the elaborate, gayly colored costume of
the Italian peasants of our childhood, but something
more picturesque than the work-a-day costume that
has disappointed us so much through Italy. The
older women had brilliantly colored kerchiefs on their
heads, while some of the younger women wore nothing
upon theirs except their own glossy, luxuriant hair,
which is always neatly and tastefully dressed.
</p>

<p>
We have often wondered why there are so many
<i>old</i> women in Italy. Is it because they live long in
this favored clime, or, sadder thought, do the young
grow old early under the heavy strain of bread-winning,
where wages are low and the mouths to be filled
numerous?
</p>

<p>
Angela, who is an enthusiastic shopper, suggested
that we should stop and buy some of the native
products, urging that a little shopping would be good
for us all and relieve our minds from the strain of
cathedrals, statues, and tombs. Indeed the fruit,
flowers, and gay handkerchiefs displayed upon the
booths were sufficiently alluring to detain us.
</p>

<p>
Most interesting were the color, movement, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183'>183</a></span>
chatter of the sunlit piazza against the gray background
of the old Palazzo del Podestà, which is
built on the ancient Etruscan wall. It is just such
contrasts that make these old Italian towns so
charming.
</p>

<p>
At one of the booths, presided over by a pretty
young peasant girl with eyes of brown velvet, Angela
found a gay red and yellow bandana which she
insisted that the <i>contadina</i> should try on. The effect
was so charming that Zelphine took the girl's picture
on the spot, to her evident delight. Nothing but a
brush and colors, the latter well mixed with the atmospheric
transparency of Perugia, could give you any
idea of the lovely effect of the girl's soft, dark eyes
and the peach-like bloom of her cheeks, both enhanced
by the brilliant head-dress. Then the signorina must
try on a kerchief. "Ecco! ecco!" Carefully selecting
one of dark blue with a yellow border, with many
exclamations and more gestures the deft peasant fingers
removed Angela's hat, and adjusted the kerchief
over her golden crescent of hair. I must confess that
the bandana became Angela well enough to excuse
the chorus of admiring expressions that arose from a
circle of voluble crones gathered around us. "Bella
donna! Bella signorina!" was heard on all sides.
Some of the women pressed near Angela to kiss her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184'>184</a></span>
hand, saying that she looked like the pictures of the
Madonna over there in the cathedral. The child was
a little frightened, and drew closer to me for protection.
Zelphine cleverly diverted the attention of the
group by taking Angela and the pretty young Rosa
Maria across the piazza to the large door of the old
Palazzo del Podestà, to take their photographs against
this fine background. Nothing could have been more
charming than the blonde and brunette heads and
graceful girlish figures against the old palace gateway.
After taking two or three pictures Zelphine thanked
Rosa Maria, pressing a silver coin into her hand; upon
which she, with charming ingenuousness, intimated
that she would take it as a wedding-gift, and, beckoning
to a handsome young peasant whom we had
noticed standing over in the shadow of the statue of
Giuseppe Garibaldi, she presented him to us with
smiles, blushes, and courtesies. Then, as we gathered
from the few words that we could understand and by
the pair standing hand in hand before Zelphine,
Umbrian etiquette demanded that she should take a
photograph of the <i>fidanzati</i> together, which congenial
task Zelphine set about with alacrity before shyness
should overcome the happy couple.
</p>

<p>
We all hope that the pictures may prove a success,
as copies are to be sent to Rosa Maria and Battista,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185'>185</a></span>
whose names we have in full, their address being the
Central Post Office of Perugia, where they are always
to be found on market-days.
</p>

<p>
The groom elect was so manly and gentle and the
little bride so sweet and confiding that they both won
our hearts. We left them with good wishes on our
part and <i>molte, molte grazie</i> on theirs. These expressions
were in view of our small contributions toward a
little household soon to be established over near Spello.
Angela, in a sudden enthusiasm over this charming
picture of young love, unfastened a pretty chain that
she wears around her neck, and linked it about that of
Rosa Maria. We shall long remember the lovers as we
left them, standing hand in hand on the sunlit Piazza
Garibaldi under the shadow of the ancient Gateway of
Justice, and they, I am sure, will never forget the
<i>forestieri</i>, above all the <i>bella signorina</i>. They will
show their children the pictures and tell them they
were taken on the old piazza; and, to be quite foreign
in my prophecy, I am certain that they will name their
first daughter Angela.
</p>

<p>
From this "charming bit of local color," as Zelphine
catalogues our little adventure, we returned to
Rosa Maria's booth, now presided over by her mother,
and bought many other bits of local color in the form
of kerchiefs&mdash;Angela more than any of us. As she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186'>186</a></span>
succumbed to the temptation of each one, she excused
herself by saying, "These people are so poor, Margaret!"
or "That gay red one will make a fine bandana
for old Susan!" or "This will cover the little table
in my morning-room." As we are travelling with
only dress-suit-cases, which are crowded with the bare
necessities of life, I know not how we are to dispose
of these new possessions, to which Zelphine has added
a number of books about Perugia and Assisi. She is
still lugging around the beloved Narcissus, from Pompeii,
because she will trust him to no trunk.
</p>

<p>
After our delightfully vagrant forenoon and a substantial
breakfast, for which we were quite ready, we
decided to dedicate the afternoon to tombs. We had
intended to visit the famous Etruscan tombs on our
way to Assisi, driving thither after the conventional
fashion of Perugian tourists, but, hearing from some
of our countrymen who sit near us at the table d'hôte
that there are two or three fairly good inns in Assisi,
we have decided to go there by rail to-morrow, and
thus have a Sunday in the good company of the blessed
St. Francis.
</p>

<p>
Angela flatly refused to go on the afternoon expedition,
saying that she had taken a full course on tombs
in Rome and would have no more of them, so Zelphine
and I drove alone to the ancient Etruscan Necropolis
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187'>187</a></span>
of Perugia, a drive of not over an hour from the Porta
Romana. These tomb chambers of the Volumnii are
most interesting, with their portrait figures in terra-cotta
and carvings of sun-gods and dolphins, quite
different from anything we have seen except in
Orvieto, and, as Angela says, we have had experience
in tombs. Zelphine and I were much impressed by the
fact that these massive stone tombs of the third century
B.C. should have been buried under the earth
until the middle of the last century, when a peasant
discovered them while ploughing. Another story is
that the tombs were unearthed when the new road was
being made, but Zelphine and I prefer the tale about
the peasant ploughing. After all, it matters little
which tradition we adopt; the wonder remains that
these richly adorned sarcophagi still testify to the
wealth and artistic ability of the Etruscans of more
than twenty-five centuries ago.
</p>

<p>
So much history lies underground in this land of
the past that we do well to tread softly lest we be, at
any moment, walking over graves, pagan or Christian;
and yet these devout Italians are far less jealous of
the desecrating foot of the stranger than the "heathen
Chinee."
</p>

<p>
When we returned from our drive we found Angela
in the gayest of moods, having evidently enjoyed her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188'>188</a></span>
respite from sight-seeing. She had met some American
acquaintances, and had afternoon tea with Mrs.
Allen and her fascinating children in the charming
hall at the Brufani, where one may sit under the shade
of palm-trees all the year round.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
May 1st.
</p>

<p>
Our modest luggage is in the hall in charge of several
porters and <i>facchini</i>, and while we wait for the
cab that is to take us to the station, I jot down a few
impressions before they are dimmed or quite swept
away by the interests of our next stopping-place.
One should really have two or three days in an absolutely
dull and unattractive place, if such a spot is to
be found in Italy, after each one of these entrancing
cities and towns. Our minds are steeped with
the beauties and associations of Perugia, and now
Assisi will overwhelm us with its own charm.
</p>

<p>
Our way this morning was down the Via Marzia
and the great stone steps of San Ercolano, by the
church of the same name, which is built against the
Etruscan wall. I wondered why Hercules should have
been canonized; but we learned afterwards that this
curious octagonal church was built in honor of Perugia's
patron saint, the heroic Bishop Ercolano, who
defended his city against the Goths thirteen hundred
years ago. From the Church of San Ercolano we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189'>189</a></span>
passed on to the Corso Cavour and the Church of San
Domenico, which has the distinction of possessing the
largest Gothic window in Italy. Here also is one of
the most beautiful tombs we have seen anywhere, that
of Pope Benedict XI. This fine monument, designed
by Giovanni Pisano, represents Benedict asleep,
guarded by two angels. Above the face and figure,
which are lovely in their perfect repose, is a lofty
canopy supported by graceful spiral columns. Bits
of the fine mosaic with which this tomb was once
enriched are to be found here and there, the greater
part having been carried off by Napoleon's soldiers,
who seem to have played much the same rôle in the
destruction and sacking of Italian churches as that
enacted by Cromwell's army in England. Indeed I
never before realized the ruthless manner in which
the French army ravaged this land of beauty and art;
we hear so much less of its depredations than of
those of the Roundheads.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine, who, for some unaccountable reason,
includes the conqueror of Europe among her heroes,
undertook to defend him, while Angela, who, perhaps
with more justice, reckons Cromwell among hers,
resented my mentioning the French and English soldiers
in the same breath, which led to an animated
discussion, in the midst of which we passed through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190'>190</a></span>
the beautiful and richly decorated Porta San Pietro,
and so on to the old Benedictine monastery, which is
now used for a very practical purpose, that of an institute
for experimental agriculture. Seeing large
bunches of millet and other cereals over the fine old
doors, we thought we had made a mistake, but some
peasants at work on the road assured us that San
Pietro was just beyond.
</p>

<p>
After passing through the agricultural school we
crossed the courtyard, and entered the great doorway
of beautiful carved stone-work, and so found ourselves
in the basilica, which, with its flat, elaborately decorated
ceiling, its high altar adorned with lapis lazuli,
agate, and other colored stones, and its many columns
of granite and marble, is wonderfully rich in depth
and harmony of color. Around the sides of the church
are a number of large paintings by Vassilacchi, two
by Guido Reni, and some charming little paintings by
Sassoferrato. But the crowning glory of the basilica,
the great Perugino of the Assumption, has been carried
off to France, although the five saints that once
surrounded it still hover above the altar.
</p>

<p>
The exquisitely carved choir-stalls of San Pietro,
attributed to Raphael, are the most beautiful that we
have seen anywhere. The lovely traceries, the infinite
variety of faces and figures, the quaint masks interspersed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191'>191</a></span>
with carvings of beasts, birds, and flowers,
could only have been designed by an artist of delicate
fancy and marvellous genius.
</p>

<p>
The verger opened the great doors at the back of
the church, thus disclosing a noble panorama of distant
hills and fertile valleys.
</p>

<p>
On the opposite side of the road is the Giardino del
Frontone, and beyond, the Porta San Costanzo,
inside of which is a church of the same name, dedicated
to the patron saint of all Perugian lovers. Here
many happy couples are to be seen wending their way
along the hillside park, to gain the blessing of the
unlovely Byzantine Madonna who presides over the
marble doorway of San Costanzo. Beyond the garden
and the church lies the wide-spread Umbrian
plain, girt about by the ample belt of the Apennines.
Off to the north and west are Cortona and Siena, with
Lago Trasimeno between, quite near, although shut
off from us by a screen of green hills. To the south,
following the windings of the Tiber, lies Rome, where
our hearts still linger, and to the east, so near that
we can see the twinkling of their lights at night, are
Foligno and Spello and Assisi, which last, we are told,
we shall end by loving more than any other spot in
Italy.

<h2>
XIII
<br />

A SUNDAY IN ASSISI
</h2>
<hr class="l30" />

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Assisi</span>, Saturday Evening, May 1st.
</p>

<p>
As we first beheld Assisi from the railroad station
at sunset, the delicate mauve pink of her towers and
walls glowed with a more rosy hue and it seemed as if
the old town for a brief moment must have worn something
of the grace of her long-vanished youth.
</p>

<p>
On one side of the station is the little village of the
plain, Santa Maria degli Angeli, with the church from
which it takes its name, so christened by St. Francis
in memory of the angelic visions here granted him.
On the other side of the road, across a sweep of green
meadows, is the town, built upon terraces half-way up
the hill, Mount Subasio towering beyond it to a height
of over three thousand feet above the sea-level. The
crowning glory of Assisi is the great basilica of San
Francesco, with its remarkable substructure&mdash;a vast
colonnaded monastery standing guard over the happy
valley beneath.
</p>

<p>
Our approach was by winding roads bordered by
hedges, with fields beyond green as England and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193'>193</a></span>
bright as Italy alone, all abloom to-day with poppies
and buttercups. Up and up the shining way climbed
the shabby <i>vettura</i> with its lean horse, until we seemed
to be getting near the blue of the sky, so close does
the arch of heaven lean to these hill towns of Italy.
</p>

<p>
We all felt that we had left the world of to-day far
behind us when we drove through the ancient Porta
San Francesco, so entirely does Assisi belong to the
past. Here where everything is ancient one ceases to
make comparisons, and it seemed no more remarkable
to find a Temple of Minerva standing beside twelfth-century
buildings, than that we three twentieth-century
Americans should be driving about these old
streets, hearing the <i>vetturino</i> talk about St. Francis
as if he had lived but yesterday.
</p>

<p>
You really must not expect an ordinary letter of
to-day from this place, where we are so absolutely
dominated by the twelfth century. Zelphine, who is
in a state of rapture and quite lifted above the ordinary
affairs of life, is probably writing a poem at this
moment, having been incited thereto by the history of
Assisi's celebrated poet, Propertius, which she has
just read to us from a charming little book which
she found in Perugia. The story runs thus: Propertius,
who was a contemporary of Virgil and Horace,
relinquished the congenial atmosphere of Rome and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194'>194</a></span>
the friendly companionship of the author of the
"Metamorphoses" for the love of his Umbrian birthplace,
where the Muse had first visited him. Recognized
in his own day as the leader of a new school of
poetry, Propertius appreciated his own powers sufficiently
to write of himself in connection with his
native town: "Ancient Umbria gave thee birth, from
a noted household. Do I mistake, or do I touch
rightly the region of your home, where misty Mevania
stands among the dews of the hill-girt plain, and the
waters of the Umbrian lake grow warm the summer
through, and where on the summit of mounting Asis
rise the walls to which genius has added glory?" His
own genius! And yet, to prove to us that he was not
wanting in modesty, Propertius has placed this charming
compliment in the mouth of a soothsayer. If this
is all familiar to you, O most learned, it is so fresh
to me that you must allow me to repeat it, because it
reveals once more the truth of the Scriptures&mdash;that a
prophet is not without honor save in his own country.
Propertius would not have been forced to sing his own
praises if his contemporaries had sung them in the
right key.
</p>

<p>
The little inn at which we are stopping, with its
bare, stone floors and whitewashed walls, is quite
primitive enough to have suited St. Francis and his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195'>195</a></span>
brothers. We are told that there is another and larger
hotel, which is more modern in its appointments.
</p>

<p>
"The idea of caring for a modern hotel or anything
modern in Assisi!" exclaimed Zelphine, walking with
me toward the window of one of the rooms offered us.
</p>

<p>
A single glance out of that window decided us to
stay. The Albergo Giotto is built on a cliff, and literally
overhangs the valley. From our windows we
look out upon green slopes billowing beneath us until
they break away into the long reaches of the plain,
where the dome of St. Mary of the Angels stands out
against the sky.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Hotel Giotto, Assisi</span>, Sunday, May 2d.
</p>

<p>
A May-day in Assisi!&mdash;could anything be more
delightful?
</p>

<p>
Last night, after dinner, or supper, or whatever the
nondescript meal is called which was served to us in
the chilly <i>salle à manger</i>, a little lady, unmistakably
American and evidently fresh from a study of the
hotel register, joined us, and asked Zelphine if she
were Miss Vernon, and did she happen to know Dr.
Vernon of New York? Zelphine, who adores her
brother, Dr. Vernon, and is immensely proud of him,
was quite ready to fall upon the little lady's neck
when she found that she was one of his admiring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196'>196</a></span>
patients, and we all adopted her at once, she, Miss
Horner by name, being alone and glad to be adopted,
as lonely women usually are in remote places.
</p>

<p>
I spoke to a bright-faced girl who sat on my right
at table, and after some conversation learned that she
had come from an old Pennsylvania town in which
we have many friends and acquaintances. Miss Morris
is also alone, and we have adopted her. Angela says
that our party is growing too rapidly, and that we
really must stop attaching waifs and strays, even if
their precious lives have been saved by our brothers,
and their social status established by the most irreproachable
visiting-lists. Angela may be right; but
after all we found it so cheering to gather around the
table in the reading-room and talk over friends at
home that we quite forgot that we had intended to
spend this evening in storing our minds with the history
and traditions of Assisi.
</p>

<p>
As I was drifting away into dreamland to the sound
of some sweet, distant bells (the bells are always ringing
in Assisi), Zelphine called in to me from her room,
"Do you think there is a spot on the habitable globe
where one would not be likely to meet some person
who had known some one who had met a friend of
our friends?" With this puzzle floating through my
mind, rather hazily I confess, I fell asleep, soothed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197'>197</a></span>
by a pleasant sense of the smallness of the world and
the friendliness of the inhabitants thereof.
</p>

<p>
This morning we banished from our minds all irrelevant
present-century associations, and have spent our
Sunday in the goodly company of the early Franciscans.
An enthusiastic party of five, for even Angela
has succumbed to the influences of Assisi, we made
our way to the Church of San Francesco, which we
approached across a wide piazza framed on both sides
by long arcades. Through the great Gothic portal,
with its rich carvings, we passed into the twilight
beauty of the lower church, for even on a bright May
morning the light in this vast basilica is "dim and
religious." The arches of the nave and chapel are
richly decorated, as you will see from the pictures
that I send you; but it was not until we reached the
south end of the eastern transept that we realized the
full beauty of these decorations, whose color glowed
like jewels in the light that reached them from three
windows in the far apse. Over the vaulting above the
high altar are the wonderful frescoes of Giotto. In
one of the most beautiful of these paintings the artist
has represented the marriage of Francis with Lady
Poverty. The cold, pale bride, her white robe torn by
the acacia thorns around her, draws away from her
lover as if to warn him of the trials and hardships
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198'>198</a></span>
that are in store for him who links his life with hers.
She, who, as Dante says,
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i11">
                    "slighted and obscure,
</p>
<p class="i1">
Thousand and hundred years and more remain'd
</p>
<p class="i1">
Without a single suitor, till he came,"
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
is now crowned with love and honor by the adoring
Francis. Dante's face appears among the many representative
and mythological spectators who are gathered
around the altar, where Christ himself gives the
hand of the saint to the Lady Poverty, while the
angels above rejoice over the holy marriage. A wonderful
conception is this, rich in color and in devotional
feeling, worthy of the hand and mind of the
realistic and imaginative Giotto.
</p>

<p>
After studying the four symbolic compositions
above the high altar we turned to Cimabue's work
in the western transept, of which in many places only
the lovely lines remain, as much of the color has faded
out. If only something could be done to save the
noble, sincere work of those who are now recognized
as early masters and regenerators of art! The colors
are fading so fast from the walls of San Francesco
that very soon these valuable frescoes will be lost to
the world.
</p>

<p>
As we turned to enter the sacristy, from which a
stairway leads to the upper church, Miss Morris called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199'>199</a></span>
our attention to a very interesting fresco of the
Madonna and Child near the door of the sacristy. In
this charming little painting the Madonna, instead of
gazing upon the Child with adoring love or placid
content, as in so many pictures, looks into his uplifted
face with a wondering, questioning look in her eyes.
Miss Morris, who is not only an artist of some merit
but an investigator of no mean order, stood before
the painting and looked her questions, upon which
our guide explained, partly in English and more in
Italian, that in this picture, by Lorenzetti, the Bambino
is represented as speaking for the first time. The
figures are a bit stiff and wooden, but the face of St.
Francis, on the left, is full of devotional feeling, and
there is something indescribably touching in the attitude
of the Child as he turns lovingly and confidingly
toward his mother, with words upon his baby lips that
all Christendom would gladly hear. We missed Miss
Morris an hour later, when we were crossing the
piazza, and found that she had returned to the little
fresco, drawn to it by an irresistible fascination.
</p>

<p>
From a narrow winding stairway we stepped into
the lofty, spacious upper church, lighted by large,
three-storied Gothic windows which flood the interior
with sunshine. Here in twenty-eight great frescoes,
executed by the pupils of Giotto, more or less faded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200'>200</a></span>
and in some places badly restored, we followed the
life of St. Francis from the early days when he is represented
as giving his cloak to a beggar to his final
parting with his brothers.
</p>

<p>
When we at last emerged from the upper church
and made our way down the outside stairway to the
piazza, the scene which met our eyes seemed strangely
modern and bizarre to us whose minds were filled with
thoughts of St. Francis and his holy life. All along
the side of the piazza were long tables filled with
relics, rosaries, and the ubiquitous postal-card, which
represents everything, real or imaginable, that has
been seen or could be seen in Assisi. Old women and
little girls were spreading out their wares under the
very shadow of the sanctuary, and we, noticing the
pinched, careworn faces of the women and the poor,
scanty clothing of the pretty little girls who helped
them, could not grudge them the limited revenue that
comes to them from their Sunday sales. The little
money that reaches these Assisian peasants is chiefly
from tourists, and from a lace-making industry that
has recently been established here. Miss Morris says
that these old women were intoxicated with delight
over the brilliancy of their financial prospects when
they were told that they could make ten cents a day
by lacework, if they plied their needles and shuttles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201'>201</a></span>
industriously. Does not everything in life depend
upon the point of view?
</p>

<p>
When we finally turned from the piazza, we
accepted the eagerly offered guidance of a lad of fourteen
or fifteen, who led us through steep, narrow
streets and under heavy stone arches to the Chiesa
Nuova. Within the walls of this so-called new church
is the house of the once prosperous cloth-merchant
Pietro Bernardone, the home in which St. Francis
spent his early years. A peasant woman unlocked a
heavy wooden door and showed us with reverent pride
the stable in which St. Francis was born, and our
young guide spelled out with care the inscription upon
one side of the church wall which records that here
the Madonna Pica, the mother of Francis, had a vision
of the future greatness of her long-desired son. The
sacristan opened the door of a cell in the wall where
Francis was confined by his father in the hope of
disenchanting his son with his chosen bride, the Lady
Poverty, and perhaps, as Angela suggested, to punish
him for having taken good cloth from the paternal
storehouse and given it to the Church. Zelphine was
shocked at the idea of any one thinking that St.
Francis could ever have done anything wrong; but as
the gift of cloth figures quite prominently in the narrative
and involves a nice question in ethics, we discussed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202'>202</a></span>
the question, with some warmth, on our way to
the Church of Santa Chiara, which is at the eastern
end of the town.
</p>

<p>
This church, handsome as it is, with its pink and
white stone, vast flying buttresses, and beautiful rose-window,
interested us far less than Santa Chiara's
convent, the San Damiano, which we visited later in
the morning. We all regretted that we had gone down
into the crypt at Santa Chiara to see the tomb of the
founder of the Poor Clares and the friend of St.
Francis. We would so much rather think of the
gentle abbess at San Damiano than lying under a
glass case in the dark crypt, the once beautiful face,
which is quite clearly outlined against her veil, darkened
by time and no longer beautiful. We turned
hastily from the crypt, and were glad to be again in
the open air and under the blue sky wending our way
to Clare's hillside convent, which is only second in
interest to the basilica of San Francesco.
</p>

<p>
It was after Clare, the daughter of Count Favorino
Scifi, had listened to the preaching of St. Francis, and
decided to devote her life to works of love and mercy,
that he prepared the San Damiano as a retreat for
her and other noble ladies who desired to accompany
her. From the hour when the high-born maiden, Clare
Scifi, yielded to the burning eloquence of Francis Bernardone,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203'>203</a></span>
to the day of her death, her story is surrounded
by all the charm of mediæval romance. The
door of the Palazzo Scifi is still shown through which
Clare escaped at night and made her way to the Portiuncula,
where, in the presence of her aunt Bianca
Guelfucci and several companions, she took upon herself
the vows of poverty and obedience. The picture
of the beautiful girl kneeling before the altar in the
dim light of the Portiuncula, while the golden glory
of her fair hair is shorn from her head, is one that
has captivated the artist as it does the traveller.
Every part of the Convent of San Damiano is associated
with the lovely young abbess. Standing in the
tiny terrace garden, with its few straggling wallflowers,
we imagined Clare taking the air in the bloom
of the lilies, surrounded by her nuns. Here is the cell
where she lay ill, when tidings reached the quiet convent
that a detachment of Saracen troops was advancing
toward Assisi. The sisters gathered around the
abbess like so many frightened doves; the bold invaders
were already scaling the walls, when Clare, who
was endowed with the high courage of her race,
appeared at an upper window, holding aloft the chalice
containing the Blessed Sacrament, which she was
allowed to keep in a little chapel near her cell. At
the sight of the holy and beautiful vision, so runs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204'>204</a></span>
the legend, the soldiers upon the walls dropped to the
ground and fled across the plain. As we saw the little
convent, peaceful and bathed in the bright sunshine
of May, it was difficult to imagine the confusion and
terror that reigned there seven hundred years ago.
</p>

<p>
Still under the spell of Francis and Clare, whose
story seems to be on the lips of all Assisi, young and
old, we spent the long spring afternoon in the basilica
of St. Mary of the Angels. The brother who showed
us about the church, a namesake of Assisi's saint,
spoke fairly good English, of which he was as proud
as a Franciscan could venture to be, and took pleasure
in relating to us some quaint and homely tales of the
early days of the order. More especially did the good
brother delight in speaking of the love of his Father
Francis for the wild creatures of the wood, which
instinctively turned to him for protection. One day a
leveret hid itself in the folds of his gown, and upon
another a timid hare sought shelter in his breast, still
returning into the father's bosom, he said, "as if it
had some hidden sense of the pitifulness of his heart."
</p>

<p>
When Angela spoke of the story that we had just
been reading of Brother Juniper and the chickens, the
brother laughed heartily, and said: "Chickens is
goot; but Brother Juniper spoiled his by cooking the
two weeks' portion of chickens in one day, and with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205'>205</a></span>
the feathers on, to save much time for prayer; but it
was not goot, and the brothers was angry."
</p>

<p>
Do you remember the story, Allan?&mdash;how Brother
Juniper set the stew upon the table, "crying up his
wares to find a customer for his unsavory dish, when,"
as the chronicler quaintly added, "there was not a
pig in all the land of Rome so famished as to have
eaten it."
</p>

<p>
"But he was goot," said our guide, "Brother
Juniper was goot, and the guardian forgive him, and
he was goot when he cut off the pig's foot and cooked
it for to make the sick man well, and the herdsman
forgive him this time and brought the maimed pig all
killed and roasted for the brothers at St. Mary of the
Little Portion to eat of it."
</p>

<p>
"This must have been the occasion," said Miss
Morris, "when St. Francis exclaimed, 'Would to
God, my brothers, that I had a whole forest of such
Junipers!'"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," said the brother, "roast pig is goot,"
leading us, as he talked, from the modern pictures that
adorn the many chapels of this large church to the most
interesting object within its walls, the Portiuncula.
Here, surrounded by much that is too modern to be in
harmony with the old, is the simple little Portiuncula,
within whose walls many pilgrims, Protestant and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206'>206</a></span>
Catholic, kneel feeling that this is a holy spot, for here
were born the high purposes and noble aspirations that
led to a great movement for purer religion in the Christian
world. Near the Portiuncula, under the same
roof, is the rude hut in which St. Francis spent his
last days, and here, opening out from the cloisters, is
the little rose-garden which witnessed his earlier
struggles with the powers of darkness. The rose-bushes
are still free from thorns, a miracle, the good
brother tells us, and spotted with blood. The green
leaves <i>are</i> covered with brown spots, the stems are
thornless. We look at them as we listen to the earnest
words of our guide; the spell is still upon us, we offer
no word of dissent; for whether the thornless rose-tree
is natural or miraculous, whether the spots on the
leaves are from blood or rust, the truth remains that
this little garden witnessed the struggle of a human
soul, and from its soil there arose something more
wonderful than the greatest miracle over material
forces ever recorded&mdash;a soul born from clouds and
darkness into life and light eternal.
</p>

<p>
An overwhelming sense of Italy, of what it means
to be in this old hill town, with its remains of Etruscan
occupation and pagan Roman and Christian
Roman life, has possessed my mind to-day. You will
never quite understand what Mr. Emerson means by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207'>207</a></span>
the oversoul until you stroll through Italian highways
and by-ways, knowing that what you tread upon is
only common earth and stone, well worn by many feet,
and yet among the many feet there were some whose
footsteps seem to have turned the common earth ways
into paths that lead to the stars. But why should I
try to explain that which is unexplainable, and to
you, who have read more books about Italy than I
shall ever read, and yet, here I triumph over you, no
books, no, nor even letters of mine, can make you
understand the compelling charm of this

<p>
The long twilight had deepened, the shadows of the
hills had lengthened upon the wide-spread plain, when
we turned from the church and the little town to
retrace our steps along the hillside road. Upon the
stillness of the evening air, seldom disturbed except
by the ringing of church-bells, there broke forth a
sound like a fog-horn, and a large red object suddenly
appeared upon the crest of the hill. There followed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208'>208</a></span>
a whizz and a whirr, a rush through the air, and a
flutter of blue and white veils, as a great automobile
sped past us along the white windings of the road.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any spot too sacred for the intrusion of
an automobile?" asked Zelphine.
</p>

<p>
"No," exclaimed Miss Horner, "not even the
tomb of St. Francis!"
</p>

<p>
"And yet," said Angela, her eyes wistfully following
the brilliant auto car and its gay company,
"I should like to be in it, this moment, speeding along
these perfect roads."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Miss Morris, "everything
depends upon the point of view, and the only one from
which an automobile is entirely unobjectionable is
when you are in it, with all its machinery in perfect
order."

<p>
You will be surprised to learn that we are still in
Assisi. Yesterday afternoon, on our way to the station
with our adopted companions, we spent an hour
at St. Mary of the Angels to take a last look at the
Portiuncula, the rose-garden, and Della Robbia's fine
terra-cotta, and then repaired to a little tea-house near
by for a parting love-feast, as we were all about to
start for different places. Miss Morris was on her
way to Perugia, Miss Horner was bound for Florence,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209'>209</a></span>
and we three for Siena. In the midst of an exchange
of cards, addresses, and quite sincere hopes of meeting
again, Bertha Linn and Mrs. Robins surprised us by
walking in, having driven over from Perugia.
</p>

<p>
You will laugh at me, I am sure, when I tell you
that those two women persuaded us, three in number,
with our luggage at the station, to go back with them
to Assisi and stay over another day. In justice to
our steadfastness of purpose I must tell you that we
only yielded when we learned, what the <i>padrone</i> had
not been clever enough to tell us, that on the following
day the feast of the Holy Cross was to be celebrated,
and the great basilica lighted with scores of wax
candles.
</p>

<p>
We are truly glad that we yielded to Bertha's persuasions.
Consistency in adhering to a schedule is
not always a jewel in one's crown, especially when one
is rewarded by such a view of the frescoes in San
Francesco as can only be had by the light of many
long candles and tapers.
</p>

<p>
It is just such incidents by the way, such turning
back and retracing of steps at one's pleasure, that
make for the happiness of the freeborn American
traveller who carries her luggage with her and is not
dominated by trunks&mdash;I say <i>her</i> instead of <i>him</i>,
because most of the travellers we meet are women;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210'>210</a></span>
and, as if to give weight to my reasoning, Bertha adds,
"In a land where one reckons time by hundreds of
years, what difference does one day more or less
make?"
</p>

<p>
"Especially," said Angela, "if you are not hampered
by a hard and fast schedule, or a conscience
about disappointing our landlady at the Pension Riccoli
in Florence."
</p>

<p>
"She will not be disappointed," said Mrs. Robins,
oracularly, and Mrs. Robins, having travelled much,
knows the ways of Italian landladies.

<p>
Do you realize that your letter in answer to
mine of March 18th from Rome was not quite within
the pact? I found it awaiting me at Siena, with a
number of others. I thought my explanation quite
clear and eminently sane, but you seem to have
strangely perverted my meaning; then you revert to
an earlier letter from La Cava, and are pleased to
imagine that we are taking risks all the time and leading
a reckless life generally. I shall really hesitate to
tell you again of any of our adventures such as that
drive home from Pæstum, which I merely related as
an amusing incident. There is no danger of brigands
in these days and we did not "need a protector,"
especially as kind Providence looked after us. That
drunken driver would not have surrendered his reins
to you or to any one except the <i>padrone</i>; and then
"all's well that ends well," and we returned from
our excursion with nothing worse than a grievance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212'>212</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I was so vexed with you for two whole days that
I wrote you not one line from Siena or Pisa. Now
your indiscretion is partially atoned for by a letter
which has just reached me here, and I am trying to
forgive you and "be friends again," as we used to
say when we were children. But the charms of Siena
are already so eclipsed by those of Florence that it is
quite impossible for me to give you an atmospheric
description of its streets and churches, above all of
the shining cathedral, rich from dome to pavement
with colored marbles, frescoes, and mosaics. This may
be no loss to you, who are doubtless well tired of my
Italian rhapsodies; but your respite is only temporary,
as I quite missed writing you that letter. I
wanted to tell you that the campanile at Pisa leans
quite as much as the little Parian model on your
desk, and about the famous Campo Santo with its
interesting paintings, and many other things. The
habit of relieving my mind of the burden of surplus
impressions, or of what I might call my "oversoul,"
has become second nature. Do you remember,
Allan, the man in Frank Stockton's story who, on
his return from abroad, found his friends and
acquaintances so much interested in their own affairs
that he engaged a young man at twenty-five cents an
hour to listen to his traveller's tales? You seem to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213'>213</a></span>
be all unwittingly playing the rôle of that youth, less
the twenty-five cents, and I, alas! shall never know
whether you prove yourself more worthy than that
faithless one, who fell asleep in the midst of the most
thrilling adventures.

</div>

<p>
I must explain to you for your benefit, when you
travel this way, that we did what is discouraged by
Baedeker and most of the guide-books; we changed
cars at Empoli and took a train to Pisa, where we
spent a night and day. The usual plan is to go
directly from Siena to Florence, and make a separate
day-trip to the city of the Leaning Tower. One
of Zelphine's pet economies is to save the retracing of
steps or railway journeys by doing all that we can
<i>en route</i>. In this case I think her plan was a good
one, as we shall never be willing to spend one whole
beautiful day in any other city, no matter how long
we may tarry in Florence. I overheard Zelphine, this
morning, telling Katharine Clarke that she intended
to stay here indefinitely and stifle the promptings of
conscience with regard to Venice and all the rest of
Italy, adding, in her earnest way, "After all, Katharine,
the true pleasure of travelling is to settle down
in one place and let its charms sink into your mind."
</p>

<p>
Katharine was so much amused at Zelphine's novel
definition of the joys of travel that she repeated it to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214'>214</a></span>
an English acquaintance, who exclaimed, "Really!"
with a delicious rising inflection, "would not that be
rather unpractical?" Refreshingly English, was it
not? The truth is, we are all well tired of short journeys,
and look forward with pleasure to a whole month
of Zelphine's kind of travelling, living in Florence
and making half-day trips to Fiesole, La Certosa, and
some of the lovely villas on the hillsides near by.
</p>

<p>
We reached Florence last night so late that the long
twilight had quite faded, and darkness veiled the
charms of this most beautiful city. As we drove along
the Lung' Arno, its lights revealed glimpses here and
there of the shining river and picturesque bridges,
with a line of dark mountains rising beyond and above
them. There is something fascinating and stimulating
to the imagination in such a first view of a strange
city, especially when, as in this instance, she discovers
fresh beauties when she lifts her veil to the morning
light.
</p>

<p>
We were not able to get into the delightful pension
that Katharine Clarke told us of. Madame had not
received my note from Assisi advising her that we
would be two days later than our appointment, and
had promptly rented our rooms, believing, like all
Italian landladies, in the proverbial "bird in the
hand." "Never mind," said Zelphine, as we turned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215'>215</a></span>
sadly away, "what is any pension, even the Pension
Riccoli, whose feasts are said to rival those of Lucullus,
compared with that incomparable last day in
Assisi with St. Francis or that other red-letter day
in the cathedral at Siena?"
</p>

<p>
"And then," said Angela, "the Pension Riccoli is a
paradise reached by many purgatorial stairs."
</p>

<p>
Being both tired and hungry by this time, we consulted
our note-books, and directed our <i>vetturino</i> to
the nearest pension. An indifferent hostel it proved
to be, with the one charm of being directly on the
Arno. Our windows opened on the river, and we were
lulled to sleep by the music of its rushing waters.
These rivers, fed by springs from neighboring hills,
are widely different from the sluggish streams of the
plain; the spirits of Undine and her kind seem to
inhabit them and sing their lullabies in storm and
calm. Zelphine evidently had the same thought, as
she told me that she had been dreaming all night of
Undine and Sir Huldebrand, and that it would not
have surprised her to have the lovely sprite appear
at her window and dash water in her face. Instead
she awoke to find Angela standing by our window, in
the freshest of pink and white morning-gowns, the
warm sun lighting up every thread of her blonde
hair to pure gold. She begged us to come to the window
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216'>216</a></span>
and look out. The Florence of the left side of
the Arno, the Florence of "Romola" and Mrs.
Browning, lay before us, with its churches and palaces,
connected with the Lung' Arno delle Grazie by the
oldest bridge in the city, the Ponte alle Grazie. Off
to the south are the heights of San Miniato, and still
further the commanding Fortezza di Belvedere, and
beyond, hill upon hill of blue velvet spanned to-day
by a sapphire sky. Behind us are the Duomo, Santa
Croce, San Marco, and a whole world of architectural
wonder and entrancing interest, the old streets
through which Dante, Michael Angelo, and Raphael
walked and the churches that resounded to the voice
of Savonarola.

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Pension C., Via Solferino</span>,
<br />
Saturday Evening.
</p>

<p>
Among surroundings of so much interest it seemed
almost a desecration to devote an hour to a search for
a pension, and yet even this practical business was
illuminated by glimpses of beauty by the way. We
passed through the Loggia dei Lanzi, with its many
statues, where Cosimo's German lancers were once
quartered, across the Piazza della Signoria and by the
Strozzi Palace. This middle-age castle, with its rough-hewn
stone walls unbroken by windows except on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217'>217</a></span>
upper floors, must have proved an impregnable fortress
in days when war was the chief occupation of the
Florentines and a man's house was primarily and
emphatically his stronghold. Although the Palazzo
Strozzi was built by a merchant, its exterior is decorated
by the handsome iron <i>fanali</i> which were used
only by the most distinguished citizens, and here are
the rings to which the party standards were once
attached. We passed the Palazzo Strozzi on our wandering
way to Thomas Cook's office, which is on the
same street, the Via Tornabuoni, with its alluring
cafés, confectioners', modistes', and bric-à-brac shops.
The massive walls and huge bulk of the old palace
form a picturesque background for the bright, varied
modern life and tourists' life of the Florence of to-day.
</p>

<p>
Katharine told us of an excellent pension on the
Via Solferino near the Cascine, which she feared
would be full, like every other place that we had
looked at, as all America seems to have come up here
from the Eastertide in Rome to spend May in Florence.
We meet more acquaintances on the Via Tornabuoni
and under the arcades of the Piazza Vittorio
Emanuele than on Fifth Avenue, and almost as many
as on Rittenhouse Square. Zelphine says that it would
be pleasant to meet some Florentines once in a while,
"or even some Romans," suggested Angela.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218'>218</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Romans never travel," replied Zelphine, in her
most encyclopædic tone; "like Parisians, their own
surroundings satisfy them entirely."
</p>

<p>
"Never travel! How strange, how dull!" exclaimed
Angela, shaking her head, incredulously.
Was she thinking of Ludovico or of the Marquis de B.,
I wondered, this apparently frank but absolutely
inscrutable Angela? She had a letter handed her at
Cook's office this morning, with a Roman postmark,
which she put in her pocket without a word or a sign
of interest. It was not in Ludovico's handwriting, I
know; whose then? Do I seem to be watching straws to
find out which way the wind blows? You must remember,
Allan, that I am the appointed chaperon of this
party, and that Angela's father, like the "Father of
his Country," has a great objection to entangling
foreign alliances. Indeed, my task is no light one,
as there are times when Zelphine needs a chaperon
quite as much as Angela; her <i>beaux yeux</i> draw many
admiring glances in our direction. But pray do not
whisper this above your breath, as Zelphine is absolutely
unconscious of the admiration that she excites,
and would accuse me of gross exaggeration, and then
a certain widower of our acquaintance might become
alarmed and feel it his duty to join us "as a protector,"
which would certainly interfere with Angela's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219'>219</a></span>
pleasure and mine, however it might affect Zelphine's
happiness.
</p>

<p>
To return to our quest, we found the Pension C.
crowded, as Katharine had feared, but Madame
assured us that she would have rooms for us in a few
days, if we would only be content with lodgings in
the dépendance for the present. The rooms shown us
were altogether captivating, with their long windows
and balconies overlooking a garden full of roses.
When Zelphine learned that in addition to their other
attractions these rooms were presided over by a maid
named Assunta, wild horses, buffaloes, or even the
more probable menace of mice would not have drawn
her from the Pension C. "Think of it, Margaret!"
she exclaimed, "to sit on a balcony overhanging a
rose-garden, and have our coffee and rolls brought to
us by Assunta! And then," added Zelphine, in her
most persuasive tone, "she seems to understand my
French, although she speaks nothing but Italian!"
Although Katharine laughed heartily at Zelphine's
argument, and said that it reminded her of a sign in
one of the shops on the Via Tornabuoni, "French
spoken and English understood," I felt this to be an
important consideration and one that would affect
our comfort even more materially than the balcony,
the rose-garden, or the pleasing name of our <i>femme
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220'>220</a></span>
de chambre</i>, and after some conversation with Madame
we concluded to await her pleasure. We are now
lodged in the dépendance, a dismal apartment-house
on the Via Montebello, connected with the pension by
a tunnel-like gallery. Here we and our belongings
hang between heaven and earth until our promised
rooms in the main house are vacant&mdash;to-morrow, or
the next day, or the next; nothing is quite certain
here, and dates do not seem to be reckoned with or
upon.
</p>

<p>
After our first dinner at the Pension C. Angela
showed her satisfaction with her new surroundings
by exclaiming, "I am glad that you two romantic
creatures have decided upon a place where the food
is so good, as we cannot be expected to live on antiquities
for many days." Angela is quite right: we are
fed upon strawberries, sugar, and cream, while succulent
asparagus, and peas as sweet as those from
your garden at Woodford, have replaced the artichokes
and fennel, of which we had grown a bit tired.
I saw Angela tremble this evening when the dish of
green peas was offered to her right-hand neighbor first,
according to the undeviating blindfold justice of
table d'hôte rules; for although Madame provides
most liberally for her guests, this woman would create
famine in a land of plenty. Our youngest made a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221'>221</a></span>
grimace over the small portion left for her on the
platter, and then with resolute cheerfulness essayed
to open a conversation with her neighbor, remarking
that we had spent a delightful morning at the Annunziata,
to which the lady, whose thoughts evidently
never rise above her plate, asked, naïvely, "Why,
what's going on there?"
</p>

<p>
In view of all that has "gone on" at the Annunziata,
especially in art, the masterpieces of Andrea del
Sarto and Ghirlandajo and the lovely Della Robbias,
we were all reduced to silence.
</p>

<p>
Although there are some charming people at the
pension, we are not particularly well placed at the
table d'hôte. Zelphine is not more fortunate in conversation
than Angela, as her neighbor is an Italian
gentleman who, although charmingly polite, is deaf
and dumb in every language save his own. Angela
and I have concluded that this Signor A. is preternaturally
dull, as Zelphine can say enough with her
eyes to make most men understand; beside which her
adroitly pronounced and cleverly emphasized French
usually appeals to the intelligent Italian imagination.
Occasionally she touches the roses on the table, and
says "Bella," when there follows a rapid flow of conversation
on the part of Signor A., through which
Zelphine smiles sweetly. She scored quite a point this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222'>222</a></span>
evening when Madame made her appearance, after
an indisposition of a couple of days, and Zelphine
bowed in recognition of the return of our presiding
genius, and, turning to her neighbor, said "Benia."
"Benia" may not be the very best Italian equivalent
for "better," but it evidently conveyed Zelphine's
idea to Signor A., who nodded his head in approval
and beamed upon her like a sunburst. He has been
her devoted slave ever since, passing everything at
his end of the table to her, evidently quite incapable
of helping himself first, and urging wine upon her
until I tremble for her sobriety. Zelphine is of a
yielding nature up to a certain point, of course,
beyond which she is a rock of steadfastness, as Angela
and I have learned in the course of our travels
together. We trust that she may discover the rocky
side of her character if Signor A. fills up her glass too
often, or makes her an offer of his heart, his hand, and
his fortune. This latter we are disposed to think is
inconsiderable, as one of his chief sources of revenue
is, as we have incidentally gathered, the keeping of
Madame's books.
</p>

<p>
Angela looks discontentedly at her own insatiable
neighbor and then at Zelphine, so tenderly cared for
by hers, and remarks in the crude slang of the day
that "Zelphine has a soft thing of it, all right!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223'>223</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A blooming widow opposite, with a daughter of
twelve at her side, wastes the sweetness of her smiles
upon the unrequiting feminine company of the pension.
The only available man, available, I mean, for
excursions and strolls in the Cascine, left this morning
for Venice, wearing a bright red necktie which the
lady has been knitting for days while he sat by her
side in the rose-garden. Angela thought it very unbecoming,
because it did not match his hair exactly,
scarlet not being the color one would choose for a red-haired
man, but then our youngest is overcritical in
the matter of color.
</p>

<p>
Further down the table d'hôte are several widows
with daughters, one, two, or three. Zelphine and I
have been wondering when the great mortality among
American men occurred, as most of the women whom
we meet are too young to be relicts of the Civil War.
The widow <i>en voyage</i> with grown daughters is the rule.
Some few wives are here who have husbands at home;
the exception is when paterfamilias accompanies the
party, and when he does, I must frankly admit that he
looks excessively bored, especially in picture-galleries.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
Sunday, May 9th.
</p>

<p>
Katharine came in this morning, bright and early,
with her hands full of roses and her head full of plans.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224'>224</a></span>
She had been modelling steadily for ten days, and,
having reached a convenient stopping-place, announced
her intention of taking a vacation of three
days, which she would be glad to devote to us and our
sight-seeing. Would it please us to go to Fiesole for
the day or to Vallombrosa? Zelphine says that we
must see Vallombrosa if we would know something
of the beauties of Paradise in advance. Milton is
said to have drawn his description of the Garden of
Eden from the lovely slopes of the Pratomagno. You,
ardent lover of the English classics, may recall a passage
in the first book of "Paradise Lost," in which
Milton speaks of Fiesole and Valdarno, and of
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i2">
  "Vallombrosa, where the Etrurian shades
</p>
<p class="i1">
High overarch'd embower."
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
As Katharine is a delightful cicerone, intelligent
and appreciative, her enthusiasm well balanced by
common sense, we were charmed by the prospect of
three days in her good company, and when she asked
us what we would do to-day, I was about to say,
properly and politely, that we would go wherever it
would please her to take us; but Zelphine interposed,
and solemnly protested that it would be quite impossible
for her to spend another day in Florence without
visiting the grave of Mrs. Browning. Being of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225'>225</a></span>
cheerful temper and not given to haunting graveyards,
Katharine seemed to have a rather vague idea of the
location of the Protestant Cemetery, but she readily
consented to Zelphine's request, and by dint of considerable
questioning we found it. Not an ideal
Campo Santo is this, like that at Rome, where tall
cypresses shut it in from the outside world, and where
the vast pyramidal Tomb of Caius Cestius overshadows
it grandly. Just outside the Porta Pinti is this
Protestant burial-ground of Florence. The old walls
that once framed it in have been removed, and it
now stands in the midst of dusty highways where
noisy trams pass to and fro with their freight of eager-eyed
tourists. Once inside the enclosure, we found
trees and shrubbery, and roses blooming everywhere.
Katharine and Angela stood under a tree to rest
beneath its grateful shade, while Zelphine walked on
and on as if drawn by a magnet, I following her, until
we stood before a square marble sarcophagus, simple
and dignified, with the initials E. B. B. on one side
and the date June 29, 1861. A cedar-tree stands
guard by the poet's grave, one branch leaning over it
protectingly, roses climb all about it, and as we stood
there, silent and reverent, a bird sang from one of the
branches overhead, and, like Browning's "wise
thrush," he sang his song
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226'>226</a></span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i17">
                                "twice over,
</p>
<p class="i1">
Lest you should think he never could recapture
</p>
<p class="i1">
The first fine careless rapture!"
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Standing by the grave of the English poetess in the
beauty of a May day, with the blue sky above it, the
air filled with the fragrance of flowers and the songs
of birds, it seemed to us that they were wise who
decided that Elizabeth Browning's tomb should
be here, in this Italy that she loved, and among the
Florentines who adored her, rather than in the vast
gloom of the abbey where her husband lies and where
she is by right entitled to rest among the great of
England.
</p>

<p>
Two other English poets sleep in this cemetery,
Arthur Hugh Clough and Walter Savage Landor.
Landor died in Florence in a house on the Via Nunziatina,
in 1864. As we stood by his grave, Zelphine
softly murmured Swinburne's lovely lines to his
brother poet:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">
"So shall thy lovers, come from far,
</p>
<p class="i2">
  Mix with thy name,
</p>
<p class="i1">
As morning-star with evening-star,
</p>
<p class="i2">
  His faultless fame."
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
This afternoon, returning from Katharine's studio,
which is beyond the Porta Romana, as we passed the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227'>227</a></span>
vast monotonous façade of Palazzo Pitti and entered
the Via Maggio, we were attracted by a tall gray house
with a white tablet above its first-floor windows.
"The Casa Guidi!" exclaimed Zelphine, reading the
words in which the Florentines recorded their love
and gratitude to the woman poet who had by her
golden ring of verse linked Italy to England. The
well-known lines by the poet Tommaseo are inscribed
in letters of gold upon the marble tablet, in Italian
of course, but I am quite sure that Zelphine could
read an inscription to the Brownings in Hindustani.
After lingering long before the windows of the <i>primo
piano</i>, which will always be associated with the Brownings,
we walked around the corner to the Piazza Santa
Felicità and looked up at the terrace where Mrs.
Browning spent so many days, and up and down
which she described her husband as walking with the
third Browning in his arms.
</p>

<p>
I must frankly confess that we were disappointed
in the terrace, as we had expected to see one of the
charming garden terraces, adorned with blooming
plants and even trees, in which the Italians delight to
find rest and seclusion above the noise and dirt of the
street; instead we saw only a balcony overhanging
the piazza, with a few straggling plants in pots. So
small is this balcony that Mr. Browning's goodly proportions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228'>228</a></span>
must have filled all the available space, even
if it was quite large enough for the fairy-like lady
who sat there through long summer days. Do you
remember that she wrote to Miss Mitford that she
was so happy despite the intense heat that she could
quite comprehend the possibility of St. Lawrence's
ecstasies on a gridiron? In another letter Mrs.
Browning wrote, "Here we can step out of the window
on a sort of balcony terrace which is quite private,
and swims over with moonlight in the evenings, and
as we live upon watermelons, iced water, and figs, and
all manner of fruit, we bear the heat with angelic
patience and felicity which are really edifying."
</p>

<p>
It is not strange that, with new happiness and
renewed health, everything in Florence was glorified
to Mrs. Browning, and that the Casa Guidi apartment,
with its windows looking out upon the Pitti
Palace on one side and on the other "toward the gray
wall of a church, called San Felice, for good omen,"
seemed a bit of Paradise.
</p>

<p>
Near the Casa Guidi are several classic spots. On
the right of the Via Maggio at the corner of the Via
Marsili is the house where Bernardo Buontalenti lived
when the great Tasso came from Ferrara to embrace
him and thank him for the beautiful scenery painted
by him which had contributed so much to the success
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229'>229</a></span>
of his "Aminta." The story runs, as told by Baldinucci,
that after thanking Buontalenti and kissing
him on the neck and forehead Tasso mounted his horse
and rode away, leaving the painter as amazed as if
he had beheld a vision from the world of spirits.
</p>

<p>
A little way beyond on the same street is the house
of Bianca Capello, from whose windows her delicate,
fascinating face looked forth for men's undoing.
Whether or not Bianca looked out from these windows
"to see the Duke go by," as Mrs. Browning says,
it was from her balcony here that she attracted the
admiration of her first husband, Pietro Bonaventuri,
with whom she eloped, and near this house he was
murdered to give place to a princely suitor. The story
of Bianca's marriage with the Grand Duke Francesco,
of which we found accounts in several books at the all-embracing
Vieusseux's, reads like a chapter of the
"Arabian Nights." Never, surely, were wrong-doing
and shame so gilded and glorified!&mdash;gilded literally,
as the bodies of men and women were painted with
gold that they might represent the deities of Olympus
in the nuptial procession of Bianca, whose own car
was drawn by real lions, while to other chariots were
harnessed horses and buffaloes dressed in the skins
of wild animals to represent griffins, unicorns, and
elephants.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230'>230</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At the corner of the Via Toscanella an old wall
marks the site of "the darksome, sad, and silent
house" where Boccaccio lived and wrote.
</p>

<p>
As we regained the Piazza Pitti and turned for one
more look at the Casa Guidi windows, Angela was
indiscreet enough to say what I had been thinking all
the time: "After all, it does not look much like a
palace, although Mrs. Browning dated some of her
letters from the Palazzo Guidi. It's just like an ordinary
apartment-house." Zelphine vouchsafed no
word in reply to this irreverent criticism, but with a
withering glance at Angela strode before us along the
Via Guicciardini and across the Ponte Vecchio, her
head in the air and her thoughts doubtless "commencing
with the skies," which were of Italy's bluest
this evening. The emotions of the day had evidently
been quite too much for Zelphine. She left us
abruptly after dinner, and shut herself up in her own
room, "to think great thoughts," Angela said, while
we more practical travellers turned to our Hare and
our Baedeker to plan out a campaign for to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
I forgot to tell you that we went across the river
this afternoon to the little American Church on the
Piazza del Carmine, where there was a short service,
after which we had quite enough daylight to study
Masaccio's interesting frescoes in the Cappella Brancacci
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231'>231</a></span>
of the Church of the Carmine near by. There
is something intensely realistic and hopelessly sad in
Masaccio's Expulsion from Paradise. Here despair
and anguish are portrayed in every feature and line;
our first parents really suffer, as Masaccio represents
them being driven by an avenging angel from the
Paradise in which, according to Filippino Lippi's
panel near by, they seem to have lived in a placid and
rather dull content before the Fall.
</p>

<p>
Angela reminds me of the lateness of the hour and
of our early start for Vallombrosa to-morrow, whither
we have elected to spend two of Katharine's holidays,
thus breaking through our resolve at the very start,
you see, and leaving Florence for two whole days; but
as you are already familiar with my sentiments on the
subject of changes of plans, I offer no apology, especially
as Katharine says that one really cannot do
justice to Vallombrosa in a hurried day's journey.

<p>
The day has been spent in driving, walking, and
climbing hills, yet we seem to feel no fatigue, so invigorating
is this air, "mountain air, sheathed in Italian
sunshine," as Mrs. Browning aptly described it. Vallombrosa
is three thousand feet above Florence&mdash;small
wonder that we have been ascending skyward since
we drove away from Pelago this morning!
</p>

<p>
Zelphine's pet project was to stop over night at the
hermitage of Il Paradisino, which is on a rock more
than two hundred feet above the old monastery of
Vallombrosa; but here again Katharine's common
sense stood us in good stead. The inn at Il Paradisino
is, she says, wretchedly kept, so we have adopted her
plan and are spending the night here in comfort. We
climbed up to the hermitage and chapel this evening
for the sunset view of the valley of the Arno, in which
Florence lies. In the far distance we could see the
strangely indented line of the mountains of Carrara,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233'>233</a></span>
with Mount Cimone, and other remote peaks of the
Apennines.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine found a copy of Mrs. Browning's letters
<i>chez</i> Vieusseux, that good friend of all English-speaking
travellers. We have brought the first volume with
us, and are thus enjoying, in Mrs. Browning's good
company, the charms of this region which she described
so vividly.
</p>

<p>
Although we did not set out from Pelago at four in
the morning, nor journey in a sledge drawn by white
oxen, but in a carriage, even in this less picturesque
conveyance we felt that we were ascending the heights
of Paradise, and were awed into silence by the rugged
grandeur of the scenery, the hills with their heads
among the clouds, the dense pine forests and the beech
and chestnut woods hanging from the mountain sides.
We were at times reminded of Switzerland, although
some of our fellow-travellers found a stronger likeness
to Norway in the black ravines, gurgling waters, and
mountain torrents; but alas and alas! as we drew
near the summit, instead of Milton's
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">
"Shade above shade, a woody theatre
</p>
<p class="i1">
Of stateliest view,"
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
we found that most of the fine trees which once
adorned the ascent had been ruthlessly destroyed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234'>234</a></span>
They tell us that a public-spirited and beauty-loving
Englishman offered to pay a fair price for some of the
goodliest trees if they might only be left standing in
their places; but the offer was refused, and the vandalism
continues. How you will mourn these noble trees
when you come here!&mdash;feeling, as you do, that the
wanton destruction of trees is a crime near to that of
homicide in the category of sins. Yet, in the midst
of this wholesale destruction, a school has been established
for the training of foresters. It is to be hoped
that this Foresteria, which occupies the old monastery
buildings, may disseminate so much light that in the
future trees may be preserved as well as planted. We
were told that thousands of trees had been planted
within a short time.
</p>

<p>
With the suppression of the monastery many of
the characteristic features of Vallombrosa have disappeared,
and so we may not see the place as the Brownings
saw it when they came here in the summer of
1847. Do you remember how they were ingloriously
expelled from the monastery at the end of five days,
as Mrs. Browning says, "by a little holy abbot with
a red face, who was given to sanctity and had set his
face against women"? We could well understand
what it would have been to those lovers of nature to
spend two months, as they had planned, in the midst
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235'>235</a></span>
of the majestic beauty of this mountain paradise. We
long inexpressibly to stay a week here and then take
a couple of days for La Verna, where again one comes
upon footprints of St. Francis and his brothers, but
we all learned from our school copybooks that "time
and tide wait for no man," and we have promised to
be in Florence to-morrow night to meet Bertha and
Mrs. Robins, who are to join us in a trip to the
Certosa on the following day. Zelphine and I make
solemn vows, as we have done in many other entrancing
spots, that we will return to Vallombrosa some
day and stay as long as we wish. These resolves comfort
us, and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;do we ever have "the time
and the place and the loved one all together," especially
the time? To-morrow we shall be up betimes to
enjoy the early morning view from Il Paradisino, with
the clouds rolling away beneath our feet to show us
once again the dome of our beloved Santa Maria del
Fiore above the shoulder of a hill, a sight which it is
worth while climbing mountains to see, and if the day
is fine, and here days usually are fine, we may even
catch a glimpse of the glistening sea beyond Florence
and its hills.

<span class='smcap'>Pension C., Florence</span>, May 12th.
</p>

<p>
We found Ludovico's cards on our return from
Vallombrosa. He had come quite unexpectedly on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236'>236</a></span>
military business, so he says, for of course he returned
later in the evening and we had a long talk with him.
He proposes to act as our guide here, as in the old
Roman days, and is planning a number of delightful
excursions for us. As the sun is very hot now we are
glad to spend our mornings in the galleries and
churches, which are delightfully cool.
</p>

<p>
This morning, to our surprise, and also, I think, to
Ludovico's, the Marquis de B. appeared. He also has
come upon military business, being in the army, like
most young Italians of good family. Indeed, as Ludovico
ingenuously remarked, the other day, "There is
nothing else for us to do, unless we go into the Church
or marry an American heiress; and neither of these,"
with perfect sang-froid and not a trace of embarrassment,
"is to my taste."
</p>

<p>
Although there is nothing in the least alarming in
the appearance of these sons of Mars, I must confess
that their arrival has filled me with misgivings. Ludovico
still bears himself with the air of frank camaraderie
that charmed us when we first met him. The
Marquis is formality itself, his manners simply perfection
as such; what lies beyond and beneath an
exterior so impressive I have never been clever enough
to discover. Both of these young men address much
of their conversation to Zelphine and me, after the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237'>237</a></span>
polite Continental fashion, yet neither one misses a
glance or a movement of Angela's, and they both furtively
watch each other. It is interesting and exciting,
and would be amusing were I not the chaperon and
temporary guardian of this apparently unconscious
charmer.
</p>

<p>
It is not easy for such good Americans as we are
to adapt our tongues to foreign titles, and for some
inexplicable reason "marquis" is much more difficult
for us "to handle," as Angela says, than
"count," and the Italian "marchese" is quite impossible.
Ludovico has relieved our embarrassment by
telling us that it is quite immaterial whether we call
his friend "marquis" or "count," as they have both
titles in his family, and several others beside.
</p>

<p>
This morning we spent in the Church of San Lorenzo,
where the first Cosimo de' Medici is buried. In one of
the chapels are some statuettes by Donatello and in the
other the world-famous Medici tombs, the thoughtful
Lorenzo, the most expressive of all marbles, and
beneath him, the Dawn and Twilight, the former the
finest of the four statues, the effort of waking from
sleep being plainly revealed in every line. The narrow
niches in which these masterpieces are placed are so
out of all proportion to their size and grandeur that,
as Ludovico pointed out to us, they seem to be slipping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238'>238</a></span>
off the pitiable pedestals which support them. Do
you remember what Ruskin said of these impressive
figures? To him they spoke "not of morning nor
evening, but of the departure and the resurrection,
the twilight and the dawn of the souls of men." Zelphine
and I think that those few lines give the <i>motif</i>
of the statues better than any of the elaborate descriptions
that have been written about them.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
May 13th.
</p>

<p>
Ludovico and Count B. accompanied us to-day on
our morning stroll through the galleries. Ludovico has
the excellent taste in art that seems born in these Latins,
and draws our attention to the best pictures in each
gallery without recourse to guide or catalogue. Count
B. doubtless has good taste also, but it is not in the
line of antiques at present, as he seldom withdraws
his eyes from Angela's face, except when she expresses
admiration or asks him some question, when he reveals
his knowledge of Florentine history and tradition by
long, erudite, and somewhat tiresome explanations.
This morning when I expressed my preference for
the Raphael Madonnas over and above all others, the
Count delivered himself quite sententiously of Vasari's
opinion of Andrea del Sarto's work, especially of
the Madonna del Sacco, which we saw again yesterday
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239'>239</a></span>
at the Annunziata, that "for drawing, grace, and
beauty of color, for liveliness and relief, no artist had
ever done the like," after which he repeated Vasari's
story of Michael Angelo writing to Raphael that there
was "a certain sorry little scrub of a painter going
about the streets of Florence who would bring the
sweat to his [Raphael's] brow, if he had his chance."
You know the tale; Browning refers to it in his
"Andrea del Sarto." The Count told this story with
a glint of humor in his handsome eyes that I have
never seen there before. Zelphine says that I am not
quite just to Count B. I am willing to admit that he
is taller and handsomer than Ludovico and has more
the air of a <i>grand seigneur</i>; but then I like Ludovico
far better, and no matter what the Count says or
whom he quotes to support his arguments in favor of
the Del Sarto Madonnas, for tenderness and motherliness
we must always come back to the Raphaels.
Our two companions found us this morning lingering
before the lovely Madonna with the Cardinal-bird,
which in its sweetness and domesticity is, I think, only
equalled by the Belle Jardinière of the Louvre.
Zelphine agrees with the Count in his estimate of Del
Sarto, but Angela and Ludovico are quite in sympathy
with me in their loyalty to Raphael. When the work
of both these great masters is so supremely beautiful,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240'>240</a></span>
it seems absurd to be discussing their comparative
merits so hotly. Which side would you take, I
wonder?
</p>

<p>
We crossed the Arno by the picture-gallery of the
Ponte Vecchio, a passageway lined with portraits of
dead-and-gone kings and queens, dukes and princesses,
many of these latter proud Spanish ladies with whom
the crafty lords of Tuscany allied themselves. How
luxurious and beauty-loving were those Medici
princes! Not content with a noble gallery of paintings
on each side of the river, Cosimo spanned the
distance between them with a third, having already
turned the Florentine butchers out of the lower part
of the Ponte Vecchio and given their stalls to goldsmiths,
whose successors still display their wares
here. Half-way across we stopped before the large
windows cut in the sides of the bridge, which frame in
a fine view of the heights of San Miniato upon one
side and on the other of the windings of the Arno
and the Cascine with its trees and shrubbery. From
the bridge, by many stairs, we reached the vast salons
of the Pitti Palace, which contain priceless treasures
of art with which photographs and engravings have
made us all familiar. We passed from one glorious
Raphael to another, pausing before a superb Del Sarto
or Murillo in a state of rapturous delight, until, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241'>241</a></span>
we stood before Fra Bartolommeo's Marriage of St.
Catherine of Siena, beautiful in composition, drawing,
and relief, a pleasant English voice at our side said,
"Rather nice, is it not?"
</p>

<p>
We turned to see a fresh-faced girl, who addressed
this remark to the typical John Bull <i>en voyage</i>. We
waited, like her, for the reply which came slowly, in a
gruff voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, rather. A pastel?"&mdash;and in just such a
tone as one might have spoken of a chromo. An
Englishwoman standing near, from the London cockney
district but evidently with an appreciation of art,
looked at the girl compassionately, and ejaculated,
"Poor lidy!" Whether the pitying tone was in consequence
of the girl's art-limitations or because the
pretty creature was the bride of the dull, red-faced
giant, with whom she walked away, hand in hand, we
shall never know, for just at this moment we heard
a clock striking one. How the morning had sped
away!
</p>

<p>
"It will be quite impossible to get back to the pension
in time for luncheon," said Angela. Upon which
Count B., with elaborate courtesy, begged us to honor
him by breakfasting with him in a little garden-café
near the entrance to the Boboli Gardens. The luncheon
had all been ordered in advance, this being, as we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242'>242</a></span>
afterwards discovered, a cleverly arranged plan of
the Count's and Ludovico's, and there was nothing
to do but accept the invitation as graciously as it was
given.
</p>

<p>
The little garden had been converted into a bower
of roses, and the table was a dream of beauty, covered
with exquisite flowers, sparkling glass and silver,
and, not less important to hungry sight-seers, the
menu was delicious. It was all like a fairy feast to
which we had been bidden by Prince Charming himself.
Zelphine said she would not be surprised to see
a white cat or a genie appear at any moment.
</p>

<p>
"Priest and book are what we are in more danger
of than white cat or genie," I whispered, as I bent
over the table to admire some rare lilies that adorned
its centre.
</p>

<p>
I feel as if a spell of enchantment were being spread
around Angela's path, and yet she talks and laughs
and is as free as air, never by word or look revealing
which of her suitors she prefers, or whether she has a
penchant for either. The modern girl is a study, as
you well know, and Angela is not the least interesting
one that I have met.
</p>

<p>
After luncheon the Count proposed that we should
stroll over to the Boboli Gardens. Here in one of the
marvellous pergolas, where, by the careful clipping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243'>243</a></span>
and training of the ilexes, a refreshing twilight shade
is to be found at high noon, we sought refuge from the
scorching heat of the sun. Again it appeared that our
host's thoughtful care had preceded us, as camp-chairs
awaited us in this green bower, and here coffee and
ices were served to us as if by magic, which we
enjoyed in the coolness of our pergola, from which
we looked forth upon the terraces beneath us, where
the horse-chestnuts are covered with pink feathery
bloom, and upon the old amphitheatre, the fountain,
and the "cyclopean massiveness" of the walls of the
great Palazzo Pitti.
</p>

<p>
The amphitheatre was filled with children at play
and nurses with babies, as it always is on the free
days at the Boboli.
</p>

<p>
"Why are the boys catching so many crickets and
putting them in cages?" asked Angela of Ludovico.
</p>

<p>
For several days we have noticed the children in
the Cascine busily engaged in catching crickets, on
the grass and among the bushes. Some of the boys
go off with dozens of them, sometimes in large cages,
but more frequently in a number of pretty little cages
of wire or wood, all strung on a stick, a single cricket
in each one.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," added Zelphine, "what is the meaning of
all this catching of crickets?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244'>244</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"For Grilli Day, of course," said Ludovico, laughing
heartily at the idea of our not knowing anything
so well known. "On the feast of the Ascension,
to-morrow, you will see what the boys do with the
<i>grilli</i>, and you will be buying <i>grilli</i> like the rest."
</p>

<p>
"And why should I buy crickets," asked Angela,
"especially as I don't like them at all?"
</p>

<p>
"For luck, of course, signorina; everybody buys
the <i>grilli</i> for luck." And then Ludovico sang, in his
light, gay Italian fashion but in a voice in which a
minor chord seemed to dominate the gay notes:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">
"'<span lang='it_IT'>Grillo, mio grillo!</span>
</p>
<p class="i1">
<span lang='it_IT'>Si tu vo' moglie dillo!</span>'"
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
To our surprise, the Count joined in Ludovico's
song, in a rich bass voice that resounded through the
little pergola and brought a crowd of urchins to our
retreat with their hands full of <i>grilli</i> in cages. The
Count laughed good-humoredly, and presented each
one of us with a caged <i>grillo</i>, saying, "For luck,
ladies; if the <i>grilli</i> live, the luck will be good; if not,"
with a shrug, "it may be good all the same."
</p>

<p>
He then insisted that Angela should buy him a
<i>grillo</i> in a cage, which she did laughingly, but which
he received quite seriously, looking as if he intended
to guard it with his life.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245'>245</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Zelphine, her thirst for knowledge still unsatisfied,
asked for information as to the origin of this curious
custom.
</p>

<p>
"It is a custom of great antiquity," replied Ludovico,
which, as we have learned by experience, is his
method of silencing troublesome American questions
that he is unable to answer. The Count, who appeared
to be in an especially genial mood, then told us many
stories and legends about the <i>grilli</i>, in which fairies
and princesses figured quite prominently and goodness
was rewarded and wickedness punished after the
charmingly judicial fashion of fairyland. One of the
prettiest of these tales we found afterwards in Mr.
Leland's "Legends of Florence," in the form of a
poem called "The King of the Crickets."
</p>

<p>
About four o'clock a delightful breeze sprang up,
and Ludovico proposed that we drive to San Miniato.
The suggestion was made apparently on the spur of
the moment, and yet when we descended from our
airy height to the street below, carriages were awaiting
us, not ordinary cabs but fairy coaches fit for
princesses.
</p>

<p>
The drive through the Porta Romana and along the
hillside road of Le Colle was enchanting. The church
which Michael Angelo called "La Bella Villanella"
is beautiful in its simplicity. After we had admired
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246'>246</a></span>
<i>some</i> of the frescoes on the walls&mdash;not all of them&mdash;and
the exquisitely wrought marble screen and pulpit,
and explored the crypt with its twenty-eight columns,
we were glad to go out upon the marble steps and
enjoy from thence the view of Florence in the distance,
and the intervening hills covered with olive-groves
and vineyards. Count B., who had lingered
with Angela in the lovely cypress avenue that leads to
the church, joined us on the terrace and took us back
into the nave to show us the chapel tomb of young
Cardinal Jacopo of the royal house of Portugal, with
its beautiful low reliefs by Luca della Robbia. Descanting
eloquently upon the virtues and charity of the
Portuguese cardinal, who died at an early age, Count
B. led us down the steps of the church and out upon
the Piazza Michelangelo, where the David stands, as
best becomes him, <i>en plein air</i>. You know that the
original marble, of which this is an admirable copy in
bronze, was sculptured for the Piazza della Signoria.
It is now carefully guarded from the elements in the
Belle Arti. This noble figure is the embodiment of
glorious, inextinguishable youth and strength, and
is to me the most inspiring of Michael Angelo's
statues.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine and I walked around the piazza to view
the statue from all sides, while Count B. and Ludovico
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247'>247</a></span>
took turns in trying to keep the sun off Angela, whose
complexion seems to require unusual care in these
days!
</p>

<p>
"Is there any other American girl who could resist
all this devotion and a title to crown it?" asked Zelphine.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have decided this important question
for Angela," said I. "What makes you think that
she will turn a deaf ear to Prince Charming's suit?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say just why. Angela is charmingly
polite and appreciative, and yet&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
At this moment, having suddenly recalled the fact
that we existed, Ludovico came over to point out to
us the beauty of the Duomo from this hill-top, Giotto's
pink tower glowing to rose in the warm sunset light.
</p>

<p>
Ludovico looks rather sad and distrait, to my thinking;
his views may differ from Zelphine's, whose
"and yet&mdash;" may be variously construed by the three
onlookers who anxiously await developments.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
Ascension Day, otherwise Grilli Day.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine and Angela, with the two cavaliers of the
party, started off early this morning in a great stage-coach
to breakfast <i>al fresco</i> in some pretty garden
after the Florentine fashion. The idea of a festival
here seems to be to breakfast or to dine anywhere in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248'>248</a></span>
space except at home; consequently all Florence seems
to be breakfasting abroad. The little dairies in and
about the Cascine are surrounded by so many tables
filled with family parties and gaily dressed folk that
they look like huge bouquets of many-colored flowers.
It is delightful to see people take their pleasure after
so natural and simple a fashion as they do in these
Latin countries. To be out of doors, with ever so
simple a menu before them, seems to make a <i>festa</i> for
these light-hearted people.
</p>

<p>
Although I admire the Florentine custom, I was
glad to stay at home to-day to write letters and to sit
in the Cascine, as I am doing this minute, where the
great trees spread "their webs of full greenery"
above me and the children are playing all around on
the grass.
</p>

<p>
I was rejoicing in the beauty and restfulness of this
lovely spot, having up to this time escaped the vendors
of <i>grilli</i>, when several boys approached me with their
crickets in especially pretty cages. <span lang="it_IT">"Quanto?"</span> I
asked, pointing to a dainty wire cage. <span lang="it_IT">"Una lira,"</span>
was the reply. This was too much by half, and having
managed to reduce the price to the proper sum, I
handed the boy a lira, and waited for the change with
the cage in my hand. The small salesman seemed to
have considerable difficulty in finding the desired
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249'>249</a></span>
change, turned out his pockets, questioned his companions,
and finally rubbed his eyes hard and began to
weep piteously. At this moment a policeman appeared,
and asked the boy what troubled him, when
he, accomplished actor that he was, pointed to the
cage in my hand, and explained that I had taken his
wares and not paid him the half lira demanded. To
prove this he pointed to his empty pockets. What he
had done with my lira, whether he had swallowed it
or deposited it with a confederate, I know not. The
policeman, looking very stern, asked me for an explanation,
which I gave in the best Italian that I could
muster, feeling quite sure that had Zelphine been
there, her ready tongue and eloquent gestures would
have convinced that distrustful policeman of my innocence.
An Englishwoman who had witnessed the
transaction approached, and gave in her testimony in
much better Italian than mine, all to no purpose.
</p>

<p>
By this time quite a crowd had gathered around us,
all deeply interested. The boy, encouraged by a sympathetic
audience, wept copiously and repeated his
tale of woe; the big policeman looked at me threateningly.
My English ally repeated her explanation,
and seeing that it made no impression, and the lira
not being in the boy's hands, she whispered to me,
"You had better pay him again for the cage; the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250'>250</a></span>
policeman is evidently on the boy's side, and between
them they may make a disagreeable scene for you."
"Never," I replied, resolutely, "but he shall have his
cage again," handing it to the little gamin, saying,
"I have paid for it twice already, but you may
have it."
</p>

<p>
The scene was already sufficiently disagreeable, and,
supported by my English friend, I made my way to
another part of the Cascine, with visions of a Florentine
court and jail floating through my mind.
</p>

<p>
"That is one of the stock tricks of these gamins,"
she explained. "It would have been all right if you
had given him the half lira at once, but with the whole
lira in his hand there came the temptation to keep it
all. These people see so little money, a lira is quite a
fortune to them."
</p>

<p>
The <i>grilli</i> had certainly brought me no luck, and I
now carefully avoid looking at a cage, although I do
want one of the pretty little wire ones to take home
with me. Perhaps Ludovico will get me one. When
he joined me later and heard of my experience, he
was so indignant that if he could have laid hands on
that small actor it is doubtful whether his histrionic
powers would have been allowed to develop to maturity.
The humor of the situation did not appeal to
him, as it did to Angela and Zelphine.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251'>251</a></span>
</p>

<p class="ralign">
May 16th.
</p>

<p>
As Ludovico and Count B. do not speak of leaving
Florence soon, we conclude that the military affairs
that keep them here must be of a rather protracted
nature. They do not, however, complain of the delay,
nor do we. To be escorted by two devoted cavaliers
through palaces and villas and gardens of delight is
an experience that one might wish to prolong indefinitely.
Halcyon days are these, truly, and if storms
and rain come, it is only at night, as we awake each
morning to find the sun shining upon the rose-garden
beneath our windows and a new day of pleasure
beckoning us on.
</p>

<p>
We have had some charming afternoons in the villas
near Florence. Yesterday we went to Sesto in a tram
that starts from the Piazza del Duomo, and from
Sesto a short walk brought us to Castello. This royal
villa, which once belonged to the Medici, is full of
family portraits, and some of its beautiful rooms look
really home-like&mdash;"as if one could live in them,"
Angela said, which remark seemed greatly to amuse
Count B., who has, I fancy, spent all his days in such
cold, formal apartments as are to be found in most of
these palaces. It was in the gardens, however, that
we were tempted to linger. Those of Castello are
elaborately laid out and adorned with fountains and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252'>252</a></span>
statues, and now with the orange and lemon trees in
blossom are filled with delicious fragrance. We
stopped so long on the terrace under the great ilexes
and beeches that the twilight had begun to fall and
the nightingales to sing before we started homeward.
<span lang="it_IT"><i>Usignuoli</i></span> Ludovico calls these birds of the night. He
and the Count were so pleased with Zelphine's delight
over Castello and its nightingales that they insisted
upon taking us this afternoon to Petraja, an even
more elaborate villa on the heights above Castello. In
this villa, which is on the southern slope of the Apennines,
Scipione Ammirato wrote his celebrated history
of Florence. In the last century Petraja was elaborately
fitted up by Victor Emmanuel II. for Madame
Mirafiore, for which reason, probably, it has not been
a favorite residence of the royal family of Italy, and
its lovely gardens and terraces are enjoyed only by
tourists and occasional visitors.

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Fiesole</span>, Tuesday, May 17th.
</p>

<p>
We women, in the absence of our cavaliers, who will
be away for two days upon some special military
service, have planned to spend a day in fairyland and
an evening in Bohemia. Is not that a sufficiently sensational
beginning to please one of our own newspapers
at home? This morning, Bertha and Mrs.
Robins having joined us, we all set forth in a tram
from the Piazza della Signoria for Fiesole. Half-way
up the hillside we stopped at the Domenico,
where Fra Angelico lived as a monk, gathering here,
as one of his brothers relates, "in abundance the
flowers of art which he seemed to have plucked from
Paradise." One of the richest of these treasures,
the Coronation of the Virgin, has been carried away
to the Louvre, but there is still in the choir of the
Domenico a lovely memorial of him&mdash;a Virgin Enthroned
between St. John the Baptist and St. John
the Evangelist. Behind the group are five guardian
angels with tributes of flowers in their hands. This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254'>254</a></span>
and a Baptism of Christ, by Lorenzo di Credi, are the
treasures of the Domenico. We stopped at La Badia
and enjoyed the fine view from its terrace, and walked
slowly past the Villa Landore, now shut in by tall
cypresses, where Walter Savage Landor once lived.
Here in these beautiful grounds described by Boccaccio
in his "Valley of Ladies," surrounded by his
little children and his many pets, Porigi the house-dog,
the cat Cincirillo, whose original sin showed itself
in a decided taste for birds, the tame martin, and
the leveret, Landor spent the most peaceful years of
a life that was far from happy. "Aerial Fiesole"
he might well name this lovely hillside garden, in
which he promised Mr. Francis Hare and his bride
"grapes, figs, and nightingale concerts galore." At
the Medici Villa, a favorite residence of Lorenzo the
Magnificent, we admired once again the unerring taste
of old Cosimo, who chose for a summer residence this
favorite spot which overhangs Florence. Brunelleschi's
superb dome, Giotto's belfry, Santa Maria
Novella, beautiful as a bride, Santa Croce, San Marco,
and San Spirito, all stood out in fairy-like beauty this
lovely May morning.
</p>

<p>
After stopping at the cathedral on the Piazza of
Fiesole, and at Santa Maria Primerana to look at a
tabernacle by one of the Della Robbias and a painting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255'>255</a></span>
by Andrea da Fiesole, Angela insisted that we had
done our whole duty as sight-seers and might now
begin to enjoy ourselves in earnest. To this Bertha
heartily agreed, suggesting that as we had come to
Fiesole for a day of rest and recreation in the open,
we should lunch on the terrace of the little hotel, and
spend the afternoon in the ancient theatre.
</p>

<p>
We have learned in Florence, even better than in
vast Rome, whose historic past appealed to us so insistently
on all sides, that it is not in the galleries and
churches, interesting as they are, that we find the most
pleasure, but in the market-places and on the streets,
with their chatter and life, or in sitting, as we sat
to-day, on the hotel terrace, with the fertile plain
spread before us and the garden at our feet, in which
the peasants were singing at their tasks. Beyond are
villa-dotted hills, and still beyond, the chain of distant
mountains veiled in purple light, which melts
into the azure sky with an indescribable charm of its
own.
</p>

<p>
Florence is on the other side of Fiesole, and from
the terrace we had a rural view, with nothing but hill,
valley, and mountain, excepting the villas, of course,
among these Vincigliata, which Katharine says we
must see if we would know what a castle of the middle
ages is like. Vincigliata is built on the ruins of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256'>256</a></span>
castle of the Bisdomini, and contains great collections
of ancient furniture and armor. We shall drive out
to Vincigliata in a coach and four some day, as this is
a favorite afternoon excursion from the Pension C.
</p>

<p>
Having finished our luncheon, which was quite Italian
and really delicious, we strolled down to the old
amphitheatre, where we sit on the stone seats and look
away toward Florence while Mrs. Robins reads to us
Browning's "Old Pictures in Florence" and "Andrea
del Sarto," both poems so full of the atmosphere
of the beautiful city.
</p>

<p>
The other day when we were at the Annunziata, at
the corner of the Via della Mandorla, we saw the little
house where Andrea and his fair and false Lucrezia
sat in the evenings and looked over toward "yonder
sober, pleasant Fiesole." We seem to see the old-world
pair sitting there
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">
"Inside that melancholy little house
</p>
<p class="i1">
We built to be so gay with,"
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Andrea with the face of an artist and dreamer, a
trifle weak withal, and she with the
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">
"Perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth,
</p>
<p class="i1">
And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird
</p>
<p class="i1">
The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare."
</p>
</div></div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257'>257</a></span>
</p>

<p>
How beautiful this Lucrezia was we know from many
a picture of Andrea's. Zelphine and I think that the
Madonna del Sacco must have been likest to her. The
superb beauty of flesh and blood, line and color, so
satisfies us that we do not miss the soul that seems to
have been wanting in the original; or did Andrea,
artist-like, give to the pictured Lucrezia graces with
which his imagination endowed her? We hope so,
for if he saw her as Browning represents her in his
poem, he must have been indeed the most unhappy
of men.
</p>

<p>
While I write, Angela and Zelphine try to get snap-shots
of us as we sit under the trees, and Katharine
warns us that we shall soon have to turn our faces
homeward, if we wish to be in time for the dinner in
Bohemia to which she invites us.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Pension C.</span>, Tuesday Evening.
</p>

<p>
Our evening in Bohemia was, in its way, quite as
much of a success as the day in fairyland. Katharine
conducted us through winding streets, whose twistings
and turnings we shall never be able to follow without
Ariadne's thread, to a café in a cellar, where artists
most do congregate. A friend of Katharine's, an
exceedingly pretty and vivacious Englishwoman,
joined us at table, and amused us very much by telling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258'>258</a></span>
us that she had sometimes been taken for an American
and was said to talk like an American, which
evidently pleased her very much. Did I think so?
I laughed, and said that she would have to talk many
different ways in order to verify the description, as
that was a part of our infinite variety. She said that
she had recently met a unique American man.
</p>

<p>
"Why unique?" asked Bertha.
</p>

<p>
"In being selfish," was the prompt reply. "All
the American men I had met before were unselfish,
chivalrous, ready to do anything and everything for
the comfort and pleasure of the women of their party;
but this man, this unique specimen, seemed to forget
that we existed."
</p>

<p>
Now was not that a pleasant hearing, and are you
not proud of the reputation of your compatriots?
</p>

<p>
While we were discussing national traits the cook,
in white cap and apron, was broiling our beefsteak
and cooking vegetables over his little charcoal fire;
these he served to us smoking hot and delicious. The
wine was brought on the table in a huge bottle, which
was weighed before and afterwards, like the unfortunates
who are fattened on cereals and predigested
foods, with this difference, that the bottle lost in
weight instead of gaining, and we paid for the shortage.
We had an <span lang="fr_FR"><i>omelette soufflée</i></span> of the lightest for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259'>259</a></span>
our dessert, after which a man in a white paper cap
handed around a tray of sweets, all manner of delicious
confections on sticks, for each of which we paid
one soldo. It was all delightfully novel and Bohemian,
and as we strolled home by the Arno, with the
sound of its rushing water in our ears, its shining
breast gleaming like silver in the moonlight, we sang
old songs, like college-girls, and were so happy that
one drop more would have caused our cup of content
to overflow in tears&mdash;and if tears had been shed it
would have been because some of those we care for
were not here to share with us the pleasure of this
day of days and this night of perfect beauty.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
May 18th.
</p>

<p>
If we think of Dante and Savonarola as we cross
the Piazza of the Signoria and walk through the narrow
winding streets that lead from it, every old building
and quaint corner recalls some line or verse of the
Brownings, husband or wife. In the Via Belle Donne
we naturally thought of them, as it was in this little
street, which opens into the Piazza di Santa Maria
Novella, that the poet lovers first made their home,
and in the Cascine, where we saw some of the lovely
Florentine beauties, as Mrs. Browning described them,
"lean and melt to music as the band plays," and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260'>260</a></span>
above all at the Belvedere, that crowns the many terraces
of the Boboli Gardens, from which height Florence,
with her domes and towers and palaces, framed
in by hills of blue velvet, answers to the poet's own
picture of the beautiful city, and

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>
To-day has been devoted to Browning pilgrimages.
An American woman at our table rashly asserted that
Mr. Browning had made a mistake in his "Statue and
the Bust" by placing the lady with the "pale brow
spirit-pure" at the window of the Riccardi Palace,
as it would be quite impossible for the great Duke
Ferdinand to look up from the Piazza of the Annunziata
at the casement of the Palazzo Riccardi, now
the Prefettura, which is way over on the Piazza San
Lorenzo. This statement may seem to you a trifle confusing;
but it was sufficiently clear to rouse Zelphine's
ire, and after breakfast we set forth determined to
clear up the seeming inconsistency. In the Piazza of
the Annunziata Duke Ferdinand still "rides by with
the royal air," as John of Bologna has represented
him, "in subtle mould of brazen shape," his face
turned directly toward the one window of the palace,
from which a terra-cotta bust should look forth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261'>261</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"This all answers perfectly to the description,"
said Angela, "except that there is no bust of the lady
at the casement; it seems as if Mr. Browning had
made a mistake this time. I really don't care very
much, but I can't stand having that flippant, red-haired
woman get the better of you, Z."
</p>

<p>
"She shall not," said Zelphine, with determination
in every line of her lithe figure. "Vieusseux to the
rescue!"
</p>

<p>
Zelphine set forth to gain what information might
be had from the library shelves, while Angela and I
crossed over to the Piazza San Lorenzo, and spent a
delightful hour in studying the wonderful frescoes
that adorn the chapel of the debatable Palazzo
Riccardi.
</p>

<p>
Here is that most remarkable procession of the
Magi winding along a rocky hillside, the perspective
of the most original character: Cosimo, <span lang="la">Pater Patriæ</span>,
well in the foreground, the Three Kings represented
by the Patriarch of Constantinople, the Emperor of
the East, and, youngest of the three, Lorenzo the Magnificent,
on a white charger. You know the painting
well, but no photograph can give you any conception
of the richness of color and exquisite details of this
impossible, fairy-like landscape, in which distant
mountains, hovering angels, birds, beasts, and flowers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262'>262</a></span>
unknown to this lower world, add to the variety and
charm of Gozzoli's great work. It is of this fresco
that Mr. Ruskin wrote, "Bright birds hover here and
there in the serene sky, and groups of angels, hand
joined with hand and wing with wing, glide and float
through the glades of the unentangled forest."
</p>

<p>
Angela and I were so absorbed in the beauty of the
painting that we had quite forgotten about Zelphine's
quest, when a voice at our side exclaimed, triumphantly:
</p>

<p>
"I have solved the riddle. The palace on the
Square of the Annunziata was a Riccardi palace at
the time of Mr. Browning's poem, and at the window
toward which Duke Ferdinand's eyes are turned
there was a bust of a lady as late as 1887. The present
Palazzo Riccardi, now the Prefettura, was once a
Medici palace; it was sold many years later to the
Riccardi family. Here Duke Ferdinand made his
feast on the night of the wedding, the one and only
time that the lovers met:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">
"'Face to face the lovers stood,
</p>
<p class="i1">
A single minute and no more,
</p>
<p class="i1">
While the bridegroom bent as a man subdued&mdash;
</p>
<p class="i1">
Bowed till his bonnet touched the floor&mdash;
</p>
<p class="i1">
For the Duke on the lady a kiss conferred,
</p>
<p class="i1">
As the courtly custom was of yore.'
</p>
</div></div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263'>263</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Cannot you see it all?" continued Zelphine, breathlessly,
quite regardless of the interest that her animated
face and eager words were exciting in the little
group around us,
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">
"'the pile which the mighty shadow makes,
</p>
<p class="i1">
For Via Largo is three-parts light,
</p>
<p class="i1">
But the palace overshadows one,
</p>
<p class="i1">
Because of a crime which may God requite!'
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
"This crime was the murder of Duke Alessandro by his
distant cousin Lorenzino, and this, you see, fixes the
fact beyond dispute that the feast was given by the
Duke in this great Riccardi palace on the Square of
San Lorenzo. Isn't it all wonderful and thrilling,
and is there any place in the world so filled to the very
brim with interest and romance as Florence?"
</p>

<p>
"No place except Rome," said Angela, true to her
first love.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but the history seems less remote here; everything
seems nearer and closer, more intimate&mdash;you
understand what I mean, Margaret."
</p>

<p>
When Zelphine appeared at the lunch table, flushed
with the joy of victory and quite ready to annihilate
her scoffing adversary, whom Angela disrespectfully
designated as "Red-top," she found, to her dismay,
that the lady had left for Venice before noon. This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264'>264</a></span>
is surely one of the incompletenesses of life. To think
of that misguided woman proceeding on her way to
scatter misinformation broadcast, when Zelphine could
have set her right in five minutes!
</p>

<p>
When Bertha heard of Zelphine's disappointment,
she was most sympathetic, and proposed, as a congenial
and solacing occupation, that we should return
that afternoon to the Square of San Lorenzo and try
to find the old stall where Mr. Browning, on a memorable
June day, bought for a lira the little volume
that contained the whole story of "The Ring and the
Book."
</p>

<p>
The piazza, a market for old clothes, old furniture,
and all manner of cooking-utensils, still answers to
Mr. Browning's description, and here, close to the
statue, which is of Giovanni delle Bande Nere, father
of the first Cosimo, is just such a table full of nondescript
rubbish as the one upon which the poet found
the parchment-covered book which furnished him with
his plot. Then at Bertha's suggestion, to humor our
fancies as to the associations of the time and place,
we followed in the poet's footsteps, as he described
himself, walking and reading,
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i7">
            "on, through street and street,
</p>
<p class="i1">
At the Strozzi, at the Pillar, at the Bridge;
</p>
<p class="i1">
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265'>265</a></span>
</p>
<p class="i1">
Till, by the time I stood at home again
</p>
<p class="i1">
In Casa Guidi by Felice Church,
</p>
<p class="i1">
Under the doorway where the black begins

<p class="i1">
With the first stone-slab of the staircase cold,
</p>
<p class="i1">
I had mastered the contents, knew the whole truth
</p>
<p class="i1">
Gathered together, bound up in this book."
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
To my surprise, when we reached the doorway of
the Casa Guidi, Bertha also entered "where the black
begins," and began to ascend "the staircase cold."
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going?" we called after her,
standing within the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Follow me," said Bertha. "I have some friends
who live in an apartment in the Casa Guidi, and we
are all invited to afternoon tea here."
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you tell us before?" asked Angela,
"so that we might have made ourselves a little
smart?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I wanted to give you all a surprise. My
friend asked me to bring you any afternoon, so I
sent a messenger to tell her that we were coming, to
make sure of her being at home, as she often spends
the afternoon up in the Boboli Gardens with her
baby."
</p>

<p>
Alas! Bertha's artist friends do not live in the
Browning apartment, as that, by some irony of fate,
is in the possession of an Austrian family; but as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266'>266</a></span>
Zelphine said, with a rapturous look in her eyes, it
was worth much to pass over the stairs that had known
the footsteps of the two poets. Mr. and Mrs. Cobbe's
apartment is on what we should call the fourth floor,
which here they more encouragingly designate the
third. Charming airy rooms, at the top of many
stairs, we found the home of the two American artists,
where a warm welcome awaited us. Later, refreshments
were served to us in the large room that corresponds
to Mrs. Browning's drawing-room on the floor
below; but whether we ate and drank ordinary cakes
and tea, or were regaled with nectar and ambrosia,
Zelphine and I cannot tell you. It was all so delightfully
homelike and yet so filled with associations that
this afternoon in the Casa Guidi will always be one
of our most cherished memories, and we parted with
our compatriots feeling that the old palace was an
appropriate setting for artist as well as for poet
lovers.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Pension C., Florence</span>, May 20th.
</p>

<p>
What will you say when I tell you that since writing
my last letter to you I have received a proposal of
marriage? M. le Marquis de B. di T., of ancient
Roman lineage and irreproachable family connections,
laid his heart, his hand, and his fortune at my feet&mdash;for
Angela. Are you amused at my rôle? I assure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267'>267</a></span>
you that it was not in the smallest degree amusing at
the time, and the fact that the <span lang="fr_FR"><i>prétendant</i></span> acted in a
highly honorable manner, and did not consult Angela
definitively before speaking to her stern guardian,
added to the difficulties of my position. I explained,
at some length, that affairs of the heart are arranged
by the young people themselves in America, always, of
course, with the consent of their parents and guardians&mdash;for
this last unqualified statement I trust that
I may be forgiven&mdash;to which I added that if Miss
Haldane returned the Count's affection, we would
both write to her father. After delivering myself of
a series of appropriate phrases I sent for Angela, and
awaited the result of the interview between the two
young persons with some anxiety, as you may believe.
You will be laughing at me and reflecting upon the
inconsistency of women when I tell you that I felt
quite disturbed over Angela's absolute and unequivocal
dismissal of the Count's suit. He has been growing
in favor with me ever since that fairy-like afternoon
at the Boboli Gardens, and when he came to take
a solemn and ceremonious farewell of me, assuring
me that he had spent the happiest hours of his life in
<i>our</i> society, and was so exquisitely courteous, so evidently
anxious to save me from embarrassment, I
found myself liking him almost as much as Ludovico.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268'>268</a></span>
We shall miss him sadly, and, to add to our sorrows,
Ludovico, loyal friend that he is, has gone with the
Count.
</p>

<p>
"Did you send him away, too, heartless one?" I
asked Angela.
</p>

<p>
She looked at me reproachfully, her lovely blue eyes
full of tears, and replied, with gentle dignity, "How
can you be so unkind, Margaret? You know very
well that I did not."
</p>

<p>
It appears that this is all that Zelphine and I are to
hear on this most exciting subject, although we are
naturally devoured with curiosity to know more. If
only Count B. had not declared himself just at this
time, when we were all so happy together in this beautiful
Florence! I am quite sure that the affair was
brought to a crisis by Angela's charming appearance
last Sunday in a ravishing costume of pale blue muslin,
her golden crescent of hair adorned with one of the
Tuscan hats that we buy for next to nothing at the
Mercato Vecchio. This particular hat was of silvery
blue turned up with white roses, and became her
almost as well as a coronet&mdash;so I am sure the Count
thought. To-day there is nothing gay in the heavens
above or on the earth beneath, as the skies, suiting
themselves to our mood, are heavy and gray, and the
Arno is dull green instead of lovely blue.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269'>269</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Convent of San Marco was decided upon as an
appropriate place in which to spend this morning, and
there, walking through the cloisters, adorned with
their exquisite frescoes, Zelphine and I to some extent
renewed our interest in life. Angela has gone off on
a sketching trip to Certosa with Katharine Clarke.
She has been wishing ever since she first saw it to get
a sketch of the Michael Angelo well in the convent
garden, and then I think that she is glad to be
away from our questioning eyes for a day. Poor
child! she looks pale and wan; the excitement of the
last weeks has been too much for her. We are thinking
seriously of leaving for Venice soon. Of course we
have not seen half the things we wish to see in Florence,
but we can never be quite as happy here as we
have been, and Miss Morris writes from Venice, urging
us to join her there for the full o' the moon.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine and I talked over our plans as we strolled
through the cloisters, and in the little convent garden
tried to fancy the great preacher of San Marco sitting
under the "damask rose-tree," with his disciples
gathered around him. The spirit of Savonarola dominates
San Marco as that of St. Francis holds one spellbound
in Assisi.
</p>

<p>
Some of the little cells of the brothers are adorned
with exquisite frescoes by Fra Angelico, which must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270'>270</a></span>
often have cheered their sad hearts. We stood in
Savonarola's own small room, which is marked by a
memorial tablet, and here in the adjoining chapel are
his rosary and the crucifix before which he knelt in
prayer.
</p>

<p>
Curious and unexpected, savoring more of the pride
of life than of the humility of the spirit, in one of the
cells of San Marco is an elaborate genealogical tree
giving the descent of the monks. It was with some
difficulty that we deciphered the name of Savonarola,
now almost obliterated by the kisses of the faithful.
</p>

<p>
One of the most beautiful paintings in the convent is
a Last Supper, by Ghirlandajo, in the smaller refectory.
This picture, with its lovely details, decorated
background, and well-spread board, does not represent
poor men or fishermen at meat; but in Italy one
becomes accustomed to the rich surroundings of
Madonnas, saints, and apostles. Realism is not
demanded; it is enough if one finds reverence and
devotion; and as Mr. Henry James says of this picture,
"the figures in their varied naturalness have a
dignity and sweetness of attitude which admits of
numberless reverential constructions." The grouping
is charming, and through open arcades one looks
beyond at a garden of full-fruited orange-trees, clusters
of fruit are scattered over the table, strange birds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271'>271</a></span>
fly through the air, and a peacock perched on the wall
looks down upon the sacred feast. I shall always
recall this painting, so lovely in composition, so rich
in color, when I think of San Marco&mdash;this and Fra
Angelico's beautiful Annunciation, which is familiar
to us all. We shall not see them soon again, or any
of the other pictures that we love so well in the Uffizi
and the Pitti and the Belle Arti; instead, we shall be
studying the Carpaccios in Venice.

</p>

<p>
The skies have cleared to-day and life looks
brighter, yet this is the anniversary of a most tragic
event, the execution of Savonarola. The great Piazza
della Signoria has been crowded with people all morning;
there have been processions, and services in the
churches, and hundreds of men and women going to
offer their tribute of flowers to the memory of the
great martyr for conscience' sake, until the tablet that
marks the spot where Savonarola's body was burned
is heaped with wreaths, crosses, and bunches of roses
of various colors. Some of these offerings have cards
attached to them with Savonarola's name written on
them; upon others are inscriptions and sentiments,
the one that most impressed us being "To Savonarola,
a Martyr to Democratic Christianity." If time has its
revenges, it has also its justifications!

<span class='smcap'>Beau Rivage, Venice</span>, May 25th.
</p>

<p>
As we first saw Venice from the train, across a
stretch of green marsh, its domes, spires, churches, and
bridges seemed to rise out of the water just as you see
them in Turner's pictures, with such an atmosphere
as that great artist knew how to paint, veiling the delicate
ethereal beauty of this bride of the sea. We were
aroused from our rapt contemplation of the scene
before us by the bustle and commotion of the arrival
of the train and questions about luggage, hotels, and
the proper fees to be given to the men who pushed our
gondola off from the landing. If ever trunks are
endurable it is when, as in Venice, one glides away
with them in a gondola over summer seas.
</p>

<p>
There was some sort of a celebration last night,
something special, I mean, for Venice must always
appear more or less <i>en fête</i>. When we stepped into a
gondola after dinner, the many boats with their gay
pennons of all colors and the skiffs with their rich
brown and yellow sails made the Grand Canal appear
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273'>273</a></span>
like a carnival of nations. And what a background
for a carnival is the Canalazzo, as the Venetians call
it, with its long vista of palaces, their <i>pali</i> painted in
various colors, the Dogana surmounted by its curious
weathercock, Fortune, aptly typifying the vicissitudes
of Venice, Santa Maria della Salute glowing in the
evening light with the shades of a bride rose, San
Giorgio of a deep red, the Doge's Palace with its long,
low water-front, the Bridge of Sighs spanning the
dark canal that lies between a palace and a prison,
and out on the open Piazzetta the two huge granite
pillars which we see in so many pictures! One of
these pillars is surmounted by the statue of St. Theodore,
an ancient and now deposed patron saint of
Venice, the other by the Lion of St. Mark, eager,
watchful, dominant, clearly defined against the blue
of the sky&mdash;for here the twilight lasts long, and far
into the night the sky is of an exquisite, translucent
blue such as one usually sees far north, much farther
north than Venice. This is a part of the atmospheric
charm, which makes it as impossible to describe this
city of pearl and opaline tints and golden and crimson
glows as it is to put the colors of a sunset on paper.
Later the moon rose, and we floated over a silver sea,
while strains of music, the cries of the gondoliers, and
the songs of pleasure-parties were wafted to us across
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274'>274</a></span>
the water. Zelphine's eyes shone with rapturous
delight; the excitement of the stimulating air and the
beauty of the scene sent the red blood to Angela's
cheeks until they flushed to as deep a rose as under
the fire of the Count de B.'s most extravagant compliments,
and I&mdash;well, I have no idea of how I looked,
I only know that I felt as if every craving for beauty
that I had known in all my life was satisfied entirely.
</p>

<p>
Miss Morris, who had already experienced her first
thrills of delight "upon such a night as this,"
watched us in silence and we were thus spared the distraction
of voluble enthusiasm; of deep, restrained
enthusiasm there was quite enough for one gondola.
</p>

</p>

<p>
We are lodged in a pleasant, airy hotel on the Grand
Canal where it begins to widen out toward the sea, and
opposite the Island of San Giorgio Maggiore. This
hotel is not absolutely in the canal, like most of the
houses of this "water-logged town," as some Western
traveller dubbed it, but has a strip of pavement in
front, just enough dry land to make us realize that we
still belong to the earth. On general principles I
should say that the Venetians never sleep, for over
the stone flagging between our hotel and the Canalazzo
people are tramping all night, laughing, chatting, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275'>275</a></span>
singing. And we, in sympathy with them, sit by the
windows for hours, feeling that the nights are too
radiantly beautiful to be devoted to so prosaic a business
as sleeping, which, as Angela remarks, "can be
done in any old place." The child has so considerately
refrained from having "the time of her life"
in Italy and from measuring things generally by
"galores," that we occasionally allow her to indulge
in an innocent bit of slang.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
May 28th.
</p>

<p>
Our days glide by as swiftly as those of the "pilgrim
stranger" in the hymn that we used to sing at
Sunday School. We spend our mornings in churches
or at the Accademia, revelling in the gorgeous canvases
of Tintoretto, Titian, Paul Veronese, and Carpaccio.
The color in Carpaccio's Presentation of
Christ in the Temple is beautiful, and as vivid as if it
had been painted yesterday, quite equal to Ghirlandajo's
in his Adoration of the Magi, which we saw at
the Foundling Hospital in Florence. The Child in
Carpaccio's Presentation is a happy, smiling human
baby, and the three little angels playing upon musical
instruments are charming. The most fascinating of
these cherubs, however, are in Giovanni Bellini's
Madonnas at the Church of the Redentore and at the
Frari. Zelphine has bought a dozen photographs of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276'>276</a></span>
her favorite cherub in the picture in which the
Madonna holds the sleeping Babe upon her lap, while
the two darling cherubs play to him on mandolins.
The little fellow on the right is not as pretty and
chubby as his brother; but to prevent jealousy between
the two I have bought some of his pictures for my collection.
</p>

<p>
Of course we spend many hours in and around St.
Mark's, for, like the bride of the Scriptures, this
church is beautiful within and without. The day after
our arrival, on our way home from the Posta and the
Rialto, through the Merceria, a part of Venice in
which one may really walk a considerable distance,
we suddenly stepped into the Piazza of San Marco,
with its fluttering pigeons, its arcades, its Clock-tower,
and at the end the marvellous façade of the church,
rich in color, its gilded mosaics glittering in the sun
and the "glorious team of horses" dashing toward
us. Since then, wherever we may be going, we always
seem to cross the Square of St. Mark, and by sunlight
or twilight or moonlight, or even electric light, by
which we saw San Marco last night when we went to
Florian's for ices, it is always bewilderingly beautiful.
Rich and varied, "gorgeous in the wild, luxurious
fancies of the East," is St. Mark's; almost too gorgeous
it would be, had not time softened and mellowed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277'>277</a></span>
its vivid colors, and if its setting were not against a
sea and sky of surpassing brilliancy.

<p class="caption"><span class='smcap'>Palazzo Rezzonico</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Our afternoons and evenings are spent on the water
or at the Lido, where we have tea in the garden, or
with one of our Philadelphia friends who has a cabin,
after the Venetian fashion, on this narrow strip of
land that runs out into the ocean. It is hot now at
mid-day, and one needs to keep out of the sun between
the hours of one and four; but after that there is
usually a breeze and always coolness at the Lido.
</p>

<p>
We spent some hours to-day in the Palazzo Rezzonico,
which now belongs to Mr. Robert Barrett
Browning. One large room on the second floor is filled
with furniture and pictures from the Casa Guidi in
Florence, among other things Mrs. Browning's little
table upon which she wrote her songs for Italy, and
her small, old-fashioned, green leather writing-desk,
which looked as if she had left it but yesterday, with
pen and paper and some pressed flowers inside. On
one side of the room, toward the canal, in a recess in
the wall, is a little shrine that the poet's son has placed
here in memory of his mother. In gold letters on a
white ground are the well-known lines from the tablet
upon the Casa Guidi.
</p>

<p>
The poet Browning spent the last weeks of his life
in a suite of rooms on the lower floor of the Palazzo
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278'>278</a></span>
Rezzonico, and here he died, which fact is recorded
upon a tablet on the outside wall. We stopped to
reread the inscription upon the gray palace wall. A
young girl who was with her mother in a gondola
quite near was reading aloud in English the Italian
words upon the tablet, "Robert Browning died in this
house, December 12, 1889," and the impressive and
quite untranslatable "Venezia pose." With a questioning
look at us she repeated the familiar lines from
"De Gustibus":
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">
"Open my heart and you will see,
</p>
<p class="i1">
Graven inside of it, 'Italy,'"
</p>
</div></div>

<p>
adding, "But I don't see where the poetry comes in."
</p>

<p>
Although Zelphine, amiable as she is, is quite capable
of withering and shrivelling with a glance any one
who speaks slightingly of Robert Browning's poetry,
she turned to the girl and said quite pleasantly, "No,
there are no rhymes or jingles, only the deep thought
of a great poet who loved Italy truly."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," exclaimed the girl, "I did not understand."
</p>

<p>
"Evidently," said Zelphine, as we rowed out into
the Grand Canal, "and for the same reason that
Kipling's girl of 'the rag and the bone and the hank
of hair' did not understand."
</p>

<p>
We really should have become used to people who
do not understand, we meet so many of them.

Sunday, June 5th.
</p>

<p>
You will be surprised to learn that we have quitted
our beloved Venice, and quite suddenly, which is, I
believe, the only way that we could have disentangled
ourselves from the allurements of that fairy city. In
the last week quite a number of our friends arrived
from Florence and elsewhere, and there have been
afternoon teas at the Lido and at Mrs. Allen's little
apartment on the Grand Canal nearly opposite the
palace of his superseded majesty, Don Carlos of Spain,
water-parties every night, and just as we were stepping
into a gondola yesterday morning, <i>en route</i> for
Padua, a note was handed to Zelphine containing a
charming invitation from Mrs. B., to take tea and
spend the afternoon with her at the Palazzino Tasso.
She has been at Borca in the Dolomites for a fortnight,
and wrote that she would be at home in time to
receive us on Monday afternoon. So you see how difficult
it was for us to get away from this fascinating
place; but having planned to take this little <i>giro</i> with
Miss Morris, we set our faces resolutely westward.
</p>

<p>
We spent a day at Padua, which is on the way to
Verona, as there are some frescoes by Mantegna,
Titian, Giotto, and Palma Vecchio that Miss Morris
was particularly anxious to see. Our visit to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280'>280</a></span>
Basilica of St. Anthony of Padua, which with its
seven domes is larger than San Marco, was not entirely
satisfactory, as a high mass was being celebrated
before the altar above which are the Donatello
bronzes, and we were obliged to return in the afternoon
or give up all thought of seeing those superb
reliefs. At the Scuola del Carmine we were abundantly
compensated for all other disappointments, as
here we found a series of frescoes representing events
in the life of the parents of the Blessed Virgin, as
realistic in design and as frank in execution as the
Giotto paintings in Assisi. We wondered in what fertile
brain had originated the pathetic story here represented
by Giotto and his pupils. Miss Morris says
that she intends to look up the story of Joachim and
Anna in the lives of the saints, assuring us that we
shall find a continuation of their domestic trials and
experiences on the walls of the Brera at Milan. No
frescoes except those at Assisi have interested us as
much as these, not on account of their beauty, but for
their human feeling. These early Paduan masters
treated sacred subjects with realistic simplicity and
yet with perfect reverence and devotional spirit.
</p>

<p>
On the piazza of the Cappella San Giorgio is Donatello's
fine bronze statue of General Gattamelata.
This statue, the Marcus Aurelius in Rome, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281'>281</a></span>
Colleoni in Venice are considered the greatest equestrian
statues in the world. Beautiful as is this Gattamelata,
which possesses all the spirit and grace of
Donatello, it does not compare with the Colleoni. No
man of bronze or marble ever sat his horse with the
strength and ease with which the grand, dominant
figure of the Italian <i>condottiere</i> sits his superb
charger and rides out boldly into space. Miss Morris
says that we may be pleased to know that Mr. Ruskin
quite agreed with us about the Colleoni.
</p>

<p>
As Verona is only a two hours' ride from Padua, we
reached here in time to gain a general view of its fine
old sculptured buildings, arches, and bridges, and to
see in the glow of sunset Diocletian's famous amphitheatre,
which looks almost as large as the Coliseum
and is more complete, as its stones have not been
carted off so ruthlessly for the building of palaces.
</p>

<p>
This morning we saw the Casa di Romeo and the
balconied home of Giulietta, sorry-looking abodes for
youth and beauty such as theirs, although some of the
carvings on these old buildings and the exterior frescoes
still suggest bygone grandeur. A beautiful outside
stairway in the Piazza dei Signori near the Scaliger
tombs so charmed Miss Morris that she stopped to
sketch it, while we visited the cathedral and several
churches.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282'>282</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We are now sitting upon a balcony&mdash;the place of all
others to sit upon a balcony, even if there is not a
Romeo in sight&mdash;listening to the song of the rushing
Adige which flows beneath us, and looking out upon
the mountains beyond. Zelphine and I are writing,
while Miss Morris and Angela make water-color
sketches of the scene before us, and try to get on
their brushes some of the soft, rich shades of brown
and yellow that time and the light of the setting sun
have given to the ancient palace of the Scaligers and
to the fourteenth-century bridge that spans the river
a short distance from this hotel. On the terrace
beneath our balcony some Italians are dining and
chatting gaily. When the lovely sunset glow has quite
faded out and the evening light has deepened to twilight,
we shall join them and dine <i>al fresco</i>.
</p>

<p>
To-morrow we take a train for Milan, that is, if
the sketches are satisfactory; if not, we may stay here
another day.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Hotel de l'Europe</span>, June 7th.
</p>

<p>
Instead of writing to you from Milan, I am sending
you another letter from Venice. A strange thing
happened yesterday, or, rather, two strange things
have happened. Zelphine came to my room at the Riva
San Lorenzo late on Sunday night, her face wearing
the anxious look that betokens an uneasy mind.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283'>283</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter, Zelphine?" I asked. "You
look as if you were trying to make up your mind."
We have long since decided that this is the mental
process that is most wearing to the brain of the traveller,
and I was not surprised when she said, "Yes,
that is the trouble. I have attempted three separate
times to answer Emily B.'s note, and I simply cannot
do it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I took for granted that you had mailed that
note on Saturday evening."
</p>

<p>
"No, Margaret, I have never written it at all.
The truth is, I want to see Mrs. B. so much that I
have almost decided to return to Venice to-morrow,
instead of going on to Milan."
</p>

<p>
"That is rather against your principles, Zelphine,
you are so much opposed to doubling journeys and
retracing steps," I said, trying to appear judicial in
my tone, although I was delighted at the idea of
returning to Venice, even for an afternoon.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know," said Zelphine, quite penitently,
"but I may not soon again have a chance of seeing
Emily B. I could meet you in Milan in a day or two."
</p>

<p>
"No, Zelphine," I said, in the tone of one who confers
a distinguished favor, "I will go back to Venice
with you. Angela may prefer to stay here, if Miss
Morris remains."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284'>284</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Angela will go with you," said our youngest,
opening her door, which was scarcely necessary, as
the transom was already open. "There is a blue necklace
in one of those fascinating shops up on the piazza
near the Clock-tower that I have been regretting ever
since we left Venice. I thought it would be an extravagance
to buy it, but nothing is extravagant when you
want it so much, and when this is the very last
chance to get it."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Zelphine, laughing at Angela's
comforting sophistry, "when your father's purse is
always ready to honor your demands upon it. But
what will Miss Morris say?"
</p>

<p>
That lady came to her door as if in answer to Zelphine's
question, saying, "I have been wishing that
I had bought another of the pretty lace collars that
they are positively giving away in one of the little
shops opposite the Church of San Zaccaria. I shall
not return to buy it, but will commission Angela to
bring it to Milan for me."
</p>

<p>
With so many good reasons for returning to Venice,
I am sure that you will agree with me in thinking that
it would have been flying in the face of Providence
and turning our backs upon the gifts of the gods not
to have retraced our steps.
</p>

<p>
I must confess to a positive thrill of delight when I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285'>285</a></span>
again beheld the shining water-ways of Venice. Even
the great warehouses, with their heaps of gorgeous
dyes and stuffs, have a picturesqueness of their own;
the palaces, no matter how dilapidated they may be,
stand out rich and sumptuous in the sunshine; luxuriant
vines depend from their balconies and drape
the seamed and cracked walls; great barges heavy with
their golden freight of fruit and melons go by; and
ever on the steps are the children, "those untiring
spectators of life." Why those children playing on
the very edge of doom do not all come to an untimely
end no man knows. The very small children are often
fastened by a strap to the arm of the mother or grandmother,
who knits placidly while her nursling plays on
the steps near the water; but for those little boys who
hop in and out of boats and hang over the piers as
they gaze into the canals there must be an especially
detailed guardian angel&mdash;the same, probably, who
saved Mr. Cross from instant death when he fell into
the Grand Canal. By the way, we are stopping at the
Hôtel de l'Europe, where he and George Eliot spent
their honeymoon, and where this accident occurred
which might have ended so tragically. You may
remember that at the time there was some foolish talk
about suicide; but we, who stand on these balconies
and terraces overhanging the water, realize that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286'>286</a></span>
drowning and suicidal intent do not need to go hand
in hand in Venice.
</p>

<p>
Our afternoon at the Palazzino Tasso was delightful.
We had tea and much pleasant conversation
with Mrs. B., in her pretty drawing-room. As she
has lived long in Venice, and in consequence of her
own literary connections has met most of the writers
who have come here, she had many pleasant and amusing
recollections to relate of the Storys, Mr. Browning,
and many other great folk.
</p>

<p>
We were afterwards taken into the large garden,
where dear old-fashioned pinks and tall annunciation
lilies filled the air with delicious fragrance. Mrs. B.
generously broke off for us great heads of lily-blooms,
which we carried off with us, sweet mementos of an
afternoon that was well worth coming back to Venice
for.
</p>

<p>
As we drew near our hotel we noticed on the terrace
a portly figure that had a familiar look, as it stood
there silhouetted against the façade of the Europe. A
strange light shone from Zelphine's eyes; but it was
Angela who broke the silence by exclaiming, "That
gentleman on the landing really looks like Mr. Leonard!"
</p>

<p>
"It <i>is</i> Mr. Leonard," I said, as we drew nearer, and
thus we recognized him first, although he was waiting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287'>287</a></span>
there for us. He naturally did not expect to see a
gondola full of women bearing tall lily-stalks in their
hands, looking for all the world like part of a Venetian
pageant. The smile that irradiated Walter Leonard's
face, when he finally recognized the three Botticelli
ladies as those he had come to seek, was beautiful to
behold. The mingling of surprise and delight on Zelphine's
face entirely exonerated her from any complicity
in this sudden appearance, although Angela
and I chaff her unmercifully about her determination
to return to see Mrs. B., and ask her if she does not
believe more strongly than ever in telepathy. It was
a rather curious coincidence, was it not? Yet, to quote
a very trite saying, "truth is stranger than fiction."
</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Villa d'Este, Lake Como</span>, June 15th.
</p>

<p>
Since my letter of June 7th, telling you of Mr.
Leonard's sudden arrival in Venice, I have not sent
you a line, not even an announcement of the engagement
which of course soon followed. How or when the
important affair was settled I know not. I can only
tell you that the happy pair came to me with shining
faces and asked for my blessing, which I freely gave.
Angela has so far withheld her approval of the match,
and is evidently very jealous of the "suitor," as she
is pleased to call Mr. Leonard. She had begun to look
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288'>288</a></span>
upon Zelphine as her particular property, and Mr.
Leonard's attempts to propitiate this unrelenting
goddess are really quite pathetic. He offers her
flowers every time that he brings them to Zelphine,
and then, as he is far too polite to overlook my claims
as chaperon-in-chief, I come in for my share of votive
offerings.
</p>

<p>
Zelphine is so pleased with her own estate that she
wishes to see all her friends equally happy. When
Angela is pale or tired, she looks at her compassionately,
and whispers to me that she is evidently regretting
the Count de B. If Angela regrets any one, it is
not the Count. She has long and frequent letters from
Ludovico, from which she reads me choice bits, and
there is always a message for me. Angela and I are
naturally thrown very much upon our own resources,
and the last days in Venice would have been rather
dull for her had they not been enlivened by a number
of entertainments given by our friends there in honor
of the <i>fidanzati</i>. At one particularly charming afternoon
tea, at the Lido, Angela was so much admired by
a young Italian that I should have had another Count
de B. affair on my hands had we not left Venice soon
after. Zelphine and Walter Leonard would have been
satisfied to stay on indefinitely, spending their afternoons
and evenings floating about in gondolas and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289'>289</a></span>
their mornings in the shops buying presents for the
children at home, whom the mamma elect has already
adopted with enthusiasm. We were, however, fairly
driven away from Venice last week by the heat and
the mosquitoes, which are said to be unusually venomous
this year. We have noticed that in whatever
place we happen to be stopping, the disagreeables are
always <i>unusual</i>.
</p>

<p>
Having spent most of the beautiful springtime in
cities, we concluded to come directly to this pretty
place on Lake Como, from whence we can make day-trips
to Milan, which is only a little over an hour from
here. The Villa d'Este, once a royal villa, now a
delightfully comfortable hotel, was for some years the
home of the discarded wife of "the most elegant gentleman
in Europe." The entrance-hall and stairways
are handsome and imposing, and the rooms spacious
and airy. We breakfast in the <i>salle de conversation</i>
and dine in a great banqueting-hall. The grounds of
the villa are quite extensive, and during her residence
here Queen Caroline interested herself in improving
them in every way, so Dr. A. tells me, for, to add to
our pleasure, my "Doctor Antonio" from San Remo
is spending the month of June here. He knows every
inch of this beautiful region and promises us many
excursions in his motor car.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290'>290</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Picturesque as is the view of the lake and mountains
from the front piazza and terrace, the part of the
grounds that we most enjoy is the hillside behind the
house, which abounds in mountain streams and cascades
over which rustic bridges have been thrown,
and where many wildwood paths lead to vine-covered
pavilions, temples of love and temples of fame, these
latter adorned with busts of distinguished men&mdash;all so
odd and foreign, and so different from our idea of
pleasure-grounds!
</p>

<p>
Adjoining the grounds of the Villa d'Este are those
of the Villa Maximilian, which was the home of the
unfortunate Archduke Maximilian and his wife during
the early and happy years of their married life.
The estate now belongs to a wealthy Milanese gentleman,
who has had the good taste to make few changes
in the house and gardens. This afternoon we all
rowed across the lake to the Villa Pliniana on the
opposite shore. This really classic spot owes its name
to a remarkable spring of water near by, which Pliny
speaks of in his letters. To-morrow we expect to make
an all-day excursion to Bellagio and Cadenabbia.
There are so many attractive resorts on the shores of
this lake that we have not yet planned for a day in
Milan at the Brera, whose wonders we hope to enjoy
in the good company of Miss Morris.

</p>

<p class="ralign">
June 17th.
</p>

<p>
I have a most humiliating confession to make: yesterday,
in getting off the boat at this landing, I made
a misstep and sprained my ankle. It is not a serious
affair, I fancy, "pas grand chose," as Dr. A. says,
but it is most vexatious, as we may be obliged to stay
here for a fortnight, and we really need a couple of
weeks in Paris to get Zelphine's trousseau and make
other preparations for the wedding, which is to be in
London the second week in July. I think the groom
elect is secretly rejoiced over this delay, although openly
most sympathetic and considerate, as it gives him a
longer time here with Zelphine, and really, if I had
looked all over Europe for a fitting scene for an accident,
and with a view to lovers, I could not have found
a more suitable place than this. Mr. Leonard says
that I apologize so abjectly for what is not my fault,
but my misfortune, that I remind him of a story that
Dr. William H. Furness used to tell of a saintly old
lady who frequently and formally apologized to her
assembled family for being so long a-dying.
</p>

<p>
It is inglorious, as Zelphine says, to have had an
accident here that I might much more conveniently
have had stepping off a ferry-boat in New York or
Brooklyn, to which Angela adds, "Yes, it would have
been so much more up-to-date to have been thrown
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292'>292</a></span>
from an auto car, and it would certainly have been
more dangerous."
</p>

<p>
I retail these bits of conversation to prove to you
that my companions are disposed to be patient and
even merry over my misfortune and their delay. And
I, aside from the inconvenience, have nothing to complain
of. I suffer little pain, under Dr. A.'s skilful
treatment, and here I am, laid up in lavender on a
sofa, in a room so spacious and elegant that I think
it must have been Queen Caroline's boudoir. The
walls and ceiling are decorated with Loves and Graces,
and the long windows open out upon a balcony from
which there is a fine view of the lake and the mountains
beyond. I have more books than I could read in
a month, sent me by the English people in the house.
Zelphine and Angela bring me flowers and fruits,
delicious great black cherries and a fruit unknown to
us which they call <i>nespole</i>. These last I fear were
stolen from Maximilian's garden, as the <i>nespole</i> hang
most temptingly over the terraces there.
</p>

<p>
Dr. A. entertains me with interesting traditions of
the neighborhood. This morning he brought me an
old French book which gives a history of this villa,
which was not, as I had supposed, a former possession
of the princely house of Este, one of whose villas we
saw at Tivoli. The name seems to have been purely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293'>293</a></span>
a fancy on the part of the Queen. I am to have some
passages translated for my benefit from a recent book
written by an Italian upon Queen Caroline and her
life at the Villa d'Este.
</p>

<p>
"A swallow without a nest, which for many years
flew from city to city in Europe, Africa, and Asia,"
this author calls the unhappy Queen, upon which Dr.
A. shrugs his shoulders, and says that bad as her husband
was, he, for his part, has little admiration for
Caroline of Brunswick. I have always entertained
the most profound sympathy for this unfortunate
lady, and we naturally have animated discussions over
her rights and wrongs. I fancy that Signor Clerci is
entirely on Dr. A.'s side of the argument, otherwise
he would not so cheerfully offer to read me passages
about the Queen's life at the Villa d'Este.
</p>

June 19th.
</p>

<p>
Last evening, to our surprise and joy, Mrs. Coxe
arrived. She had learned that we were here, and of
my accident, from Miss Morris, whom she met in
Milan, and came at once, like the good Samaritan that
she is, to cheer and comfort me. Now that I have so
agreeable a companion, the rest of my party will not
hesitate to go to Milan for a day at the Brera.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Coxe is a perfect dear, and entertains me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294'>294</a></span>
immensely; but, with all the blessings that I have been
recounting to you, I feel a bit homesick to-night. Am
I not unreasonable? The truth is, I shall miss Zelphine
sadly if she and Mr. Leonard sail in August and
if Angela and I do not return until October. Is there
any chance of your getting over to England this
summer? You had better come in time for the wedding.

ANGELA'S LETTER
</h2>
<hr class="l30" />

<p class="ralign">
<span class='smcap'>Villa d'Este, Lake Como</span>, June 27th.
</p>

<p>
<span class='smcap'>Dear Mamma</span>:
</p>

<p>
When you next send your only daughter
abroad, I advise you to choose for her guardians and
companions the young and giddy rather than the
mature and sedate. Here am I, the youngest of the
party and "the likeliest," as Aunt Lyddy would say,
in the curious position of chaperon to my elders and
betters, which is not easy, as I have never learned
the art of being in two places at one time. If it were
not for Mrs. Coxe I really do not know what would
become of me, as my happy couples usually choose to
be in different places. I generally attach myself to Z.
and Mr. Leonard, who treat me with studied politeness,
although I am quite sure that they would rather
have me in the lake or anywhere else than just where
I am, tagging after them. It seems more important
to chaperon Z. thoroughly, because she attracts so
much attention. Her white hair and dark eyes always
give her quite an air, and now, since Mr. Leonard's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296'>296</a></span>
appearance upon the scene, she has dropped ten years
from her shoulders and developed into a pinkness and
whiteness of complexion that might cause grave
doubts on the part of her chaperon were she not generally
in attendance at her toilet. Why Z. should be
any happier than she was before Mr. Leonard claimed
her for his own I fail to understand. She had everything
that heart could desire&mdash;health, good looks,
plenty of money, and freedom to travel to the ends of
the earth with Margaret and me, and the certainty that
she could have Mr. Leonard at her feet whenever she
wished, which Margaret and I think is quite an ideal
position for a lover. If he had not followed Z. over
here and taken advantage of her being in a strange
country, with no one but two helpless women to protect
her, and made love to her in gondolas by moonlight,
and sighed for her under the Bridge of Sighs,
and talked of their future happiness under the Ponte
del Paradiso and other perfect places, I doubt whether
she would have accepted him, for several years at
least&mdash;and then the children! Mrs. Coxe says that Z.
had better take all the pleasure she can get out of this
trip, as she will not be able to get away soon again,
with all those children hanging around her. But I
must tell you the rest of the story, as it is simply
thrilling and as good as a novel.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297'>297</a></span>
</p>

<p>
For some time I have had my suspicions about Margaret.
I told you how sad and depressed she was
when we sailed, and what an effort she made to appear
cheerful. I suppose she really did care for that Mr.
Grant, although you and papa thought him a rather
poor affair and not at all worthy of her. In the last
two months she has been quite different, and positively
gay at times, especially so on mail days. Z. and I both
noticed this, or, rather, Z. did notice it before she gave
up her interest in the things around her. We didn't
think so much of the long letters that Margaret was
always sending off to Mr. Ramsay, because, as Z.
said, they were old friends, and she was quite frank
about the letters and assured us that they were for his
mother's entertainment as much as for Mr. Ramsay's.
This sounded very nice and proper, and as Margaret
always seemed a truthful person, I believed her, and
so did Z., but then Z. believes in every one until they
are proved to be thieves and pickpockets. What really
aroused my suspicions was Margaret's absent manner,
on occasions. Several times, when I have come upon
her suddenly, sitting in one of the romantic seats up
on Queen Caroline's terrace, with a book in her lap
and her eyes gazing off into space, she has started,
blushed, and begun to read her book diligently. This
was of course before the accident. Since then she has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298'>298</a></span>
been in a constant state of apology for keeping us here
so long, and spends her days studying maps and
guide-books to find out how fast we can travel when
we are once fairly started. Mr. Leonard and Z. both
assure her that they could not be happier anywhere
else, and their looks certainly do not belie their words;
and I tell her that nothing could please me better than
to stay in this lovely, cool place, where we may make
a new excursion every day, and Dr. A. is always ready
to take me in his motor car if only Z. and Mr. Leonard
will sit in the back of the car to do propriety. He
seems to forget that I am chaperoning them; but it
really doesn't make any difference so long as the proprieties
are attended to&mdash;you know how much more
exacting they are over here than at home.
</p>

<p>
Count B.'s ideas of propriety used to amuse us so
much when we were in Florence. He would pay me
compliments by the yard about my cheeks and my
hair, speeches that we should think rather bad form
at home, and yet when he was walking with me, he
would never by any chance go out of Margaret's or
Z.'s sight. At first this made me feel uncomfortable,
as if he really was afraid that I should do or say
something improper. Ludovico Baldini, who has been
in America long enough to know something of our
ways, was much amused when I said this, but insisted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299'>299</a></span>
that the Count was quite right, as a <i>jeune fille</i> must
be rigidly shadowed by her chaperon on the Continent.
</p>

<p>
Dr. A. is a really delightful person. We generally
call him "Doctor Antonio," because he reminds Margaret
of the Doctor in that queer, old, deadly romantic
novel that you are so fond of, and then his Italian
name is so difficult to twist around our American
tongues! He and Mrs. Coxe have an occasional tilt,
which helps to liven us up. She is perfectly dear and
the best fun in the world, but she is a bit bossy, all
the same, and sets up her opinion against the Doctor's,
because, as she is so fond of saying, "Having
brought up a family of eight children, of course I
know more than these young physicians."
</p>

<p>
Yesterday when Dr. A. had Margaret out on the
terrace in a rolling chair, he said, "To-morrow we
will have a little turn in the auto car." To this Mrs.
Coxe objected quite decidedly, said that it was madness
to attempt so much exertion, etc. The Doctor
listened to all that she had to say, with the most
angelic patience, and when she was suddenly called
away to receive a visitor, Margaret smiled, and said
quite apologetically, "It is quite evident, Dr. A.,
that Mrs. Coxe is the daughter of a major-general."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes!" exclaimed Dr. A., shrugging his shoulders,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300'>300</a></span>
"I quite understand. I knew the daughters of
General Garibaldi, and they were just the same."
</p>

<p>
"And," said Margaret, "we shall have our trip in
the auto car?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, I never allow any one to interfere with
my practice."
</p>

<p>
"Even the mother of eight grown children, all
well brought up?"
</p>

<p>
The Doctor is bright and quick at catching on to
our little jokes and asides. I like him so much that I
had almost made up my mind to Margaret's marrying
a foreigner, when&mdash;but I must not run ahead of my
story, and of course I have no reason to think that
he has asked her to marry him.
</p>

<p>
This afternoon (it really seems as if two whole
weeks had passed since yesterday) Dr. A. said that he
thought Margaret could stand the ride to Varese,
which is about eighteen miles from Como. We were
all delighted, and after <i>déjeuner</i> we set forth in gay
good spirits, Margaret on the front seat with Dr. A.
and I behind with Zelphine and Mr. Leonard.
</p>

<p>
Our way lay through a fine farming country with
fertile fields and bits of woodland here and there,
quite different from the rocky hillsides covered with
grape-vines and olives that we have seen so much of all
through Italy. The roads are fine, and a rush through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301'>301</a></span>
the fresh air is so intoxicating to me, as you know,
that even the company of two lovers, so absorbed in
each other that they probably did not know whether
they were in Italy or in Ireland, was quite powerless
to take off the keen edge of my enjoyment, beside
which I could talk to Margaret and Dr. A., who
pointed out all the places of interest to us as we sped
along. We did not stop in the town of Varese, as
the Grand Hôtel on Lake Varese was our destination.
Here we sat out in the garden overlooking the lake,
with a fine view of the whole chain of the Western
Alps spread before us, "a fine panorama," as the
Doctor calls it. We had tea on the terrace and enjoyed
ourselves generally, Dr. A. and Mr. Leonard trying
which could tell the most amusing stories.
</p>

<p>
We flew home from Varese on the wings of the wind,
far faster than we made the trip there, and as we
drew up before the villa, Margaret laughing and talking
to Dr. A., by far the gayest of the party, whom
should we see standing on the piazza but Mr. Ramsey!
</p>

<p>
Such a curious expression crossed his face when he
saw Margaret&mdash;surprise, wonder, something like pain;
and she grew so pale that I expected her to faint the
next minute. Dr. A. whisked a bottle of something
out of his pocket and called for water and gave Margaret
some drops, all in such a professional manner
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302'>302</a></span>
that Mr. Ramsay's spirits revived as quickly as if he
had taken the dose himself, and by the time the invalid
was ready to get out of the car both their faces were
as red as peonies. The Doctor and Mr. Ramsay then
shook hands in a friendly manner, which was a relief
to my mind, as for the first few minutes visions of
pistols and coffee at five o'clock in the morning floated
through my brain. They really did glare at each other
at first. As they helped Margaret out very carefully,
a question suddenly occurred to me: how did Mr.
Ramsay know anything about the sprained ankle?
Papa always said that I would make a good detective.
I turned suddenly to Mr. Leonard with my question.
From his confused and unsatisfactory answer, and a
quizzical look in his eyes when he met Mr. Ramsay's,
I am almost certain that there has been some collusion
between the two. I have been counting the days since
Margaret's accident, and I find that Mr. Ramsay
sailed two days after it. He took a fast steamer and
landed at Southampton, all of which confirms me in
my suspicion that Mr. Leonard sent him a cablegram.
You don't approve of betting, mammy dear, but I am
quite willing to wager my new Leghorn hat, which
Margaret says is very becoming, against Z.'s fine pearl
necklace, that Mr. Leonard gave her, that he had a
hand in this, having learned by experience that sudden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303'>303</a></span>
appearances are sometimes the most satisfactory
ways of settling difficulties of long standing. I shall
probably know all about this some day, and whatever
Mr. Leonard did or did not do, he will doubtless be
forgiven, as from present appearances I should say
that Margaret is incapable of cherishing anger against
any living thing.
</p>

<p class="ralign">
June 30th.
</p>

<p>
And now, dearest mammy, what do you think of
my two frisky chaperons, who planned this trip for
their own improvement and mine?
</p>

<p>
There is to be a double wedding, of course. Z.'s
date is postponed until some time later in July; as
soon as the happy day is named I will let you know.
</p>

<p>
Before I close this long letter I must tell you of the
wedding journey that Margaret and Mr. Ramsay are
planning&mdash;nothing less sentimental than to come back
to Italy and visit all the places that she has been writing
about in her letters. They, the places, will not
look half so pretty in the autumn as in the spring, but
that won't make much difference to them. If they
invite me very cordially, I may go with them. You
see, I shall be reduced to the necessity of tagging on to
one of these couples, or of marrying some one myself
for the sake of having a travelling companion, unless
you and papa come over here and look after me a bit.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304'>304</a></span>
Another reason for your coming: there is no proper
person to give Margaret away. Mrs. Coxe says that I
shall have to do it, as the dignified chaperon of the
party. I really think that this and my unprotected
position are sufficient reasons for papa's coming to the
wedding, so make your plans, like a dear, and work
papa up to the starting-point. Dr. Vernon is to join
us in Paris, so Z. will be given away by her natural
protector.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Coxe is going up to London for the wedding,
and I am quite certain that Margaret's young Italian
friend, Ludovico Baldini, will be there, and perhaps
the Marquis de B.&mdash;who knows? I for one do not.
</p>

<p>
Margaret's ankle is almost well; she walked the
length of the piazza to-day, with the Doctor on one
side and Mr. Ramsay on the other. The Doctor is
delighted with the improvement in his patient, and yet
he looks quite serious when we talk of leaving next
week for Lucerne, <i>en route</i> for Paris. Here he comes
to ask me to take a spin in his auto car. As Margaret
and Z. are both up on the hillside with their suitors
(I have given up all attempts to chaperon them), I
shall have to look up Mrs. Coxe and make her go with
me. She hates automobiles, poor soul!&mdash;says they
take away her breath and make her heart thump, but
she will have to go all the same. I shouldn't in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305'>305</a></span>
least object to going with Dr. A. alone, but he would
be scandalized at the mere mention of such a reckless
proceeding, so Mrs. Coxe must be sacrificed to the
proprieties.
</p>

<p>
I wish you knew Dr. A. He is a perfect dear. I
am sure that you would like him.
</p>

<p>
This is the longest letter that I have ever written,
but then there was so much to tell you, and as Margaret
seems to have forgotten how to write, some one
must do it for the party. Hoping to see you and papa
in Paris or London, believe me
</p>
